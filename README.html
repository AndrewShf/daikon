<h1>Daikon invariant detector distribution</h1>

<p>
This is the distribution of the
<a href="http://pag.csail.mit.edu/daikon/">Daikon invariant detector</a>,
Daikon version 4.6.4, released June 23, 2010.
<p>

<p>
You should start out by reading the
<a href="doc/index.html">documentation</a> which includes
installation instructions.<br />
If you are building from source and have not yet built the documentation,
then the links on that page will not yet work.  In that case, see
<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/daikon/dist/doc/">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/daikon/dist/doc/</a>
for instructions on building the documentation, then return to reading the
local copy, which is likely to be more up-to-date than the webpage.
