This is the distribution of the Daikon invariant detector,
Daikon version 4.6.4, released June 23, 2010.

For documentation, including installation instructions, see the "doc"
subdirectory.  You can start with file
  doc/index.html
If you are building from source and have not yet built the documentation,
then the links on that page will not yet work.  In that case, see
http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/daikon/dist/doc/ for instructions on
building the documentation, then return to reading the local copy, which is
likely to be more up-to-date than the webpage.
