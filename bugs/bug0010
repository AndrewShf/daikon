Tool:         dfej
Owner:        adonovan <adonovan@lcs.mit.edu>
Summary:      instr-in-place sometimes happens twice
Status:       New
Reproducible: No
Severity:     Vexing
Description:

Sometimes dfej will attempt to instrument already-instrumented files,
causing a bunch of symbol-multiply-defined errors.

Anyone know why this is?

: Apparently it's because it fails to complete the first time around. 
   [adonovan]

: But instrument-in-place should first, always, make a backup copy of
  the file, and then instrument; and if the backup exists, will use
  that for input for instrumenting.  So I really think the problem
  would be that it doesn't recognize that it *should* be instrumenting
  in place. [mistere]
