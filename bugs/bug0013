Tool:         dfej
Summary:      missing values in trace instrumentation
Severity:     Vexing
Status:       Closed
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

[mistere]: This is a duplicate of 16; furthermore, I fixed this in CVS
dfej a while ago.  Alan, you can close this bug out.

In the RatTermVec test, it seems that the hashcode (pointer) for
'this.wrapped' is no longer being instrumented!  'this.wrapped' is a
field of type ArrayList in PolyCalc/RatTermVec.java, so maybe
something with the List instrumenting code is in error?  If you can
take at look at it, that would be great.  I suspect you'll have to
make a fresh checkout of dfej to work with, if you have significant
changes on your end already. [mistere]

P.S. One other point: ajax crashes on RatTermVec (and therefore
RatPoly) because of the 'wrapped[]' field.  It is the elements of an
ArrayList, but ajax thinks its an array (I think).  This changes a few
lines in the output (compared to the goal) due to missing
comparability information. [mistere]
