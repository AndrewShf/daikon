Tool:         dfej (Ajax)
Summary:      Crash on myvector[] elements (can't find array)
Severity:     Vexing
Status:       New
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

ajax crashes on RatTermVec (and therefore RatPoly) because of the
'wrapped[]' field.  It is the elements of an ArrayList, but ajax
thinks its an array (I think).  This changes a few lines in the output
(compared to the goal) due to missing comparability
information. [mistere]
