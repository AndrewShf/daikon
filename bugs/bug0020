Tool:         Daikon
Summary:      compilation of splitters sometimes fails
Severity:     Vexing
Status:       New
Reproducible: Dunno
Description:

When a .spinfo file is supplied to Daikon, it creates splitter files
in /tmp/daikon*Split/ and tries to compile them.  However there are
sometimes  errors in those source files, eg. the string:

   VarInfo return[]daikon_caller;

appeared in one of the class definitions as if it was a field defn.

When this happens the java compiler threads just sit there and Daikon
hangs, waiting.


- Also, even when it works, daikon never seems to remove the stuff
  created in the temp dir, which thus stays there for 10 days. [adonovan]
