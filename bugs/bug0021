Summary:      '$' in identifiers causes splitter-code regexps to break
Severity:     Lethal
Status:       New
Reproducible: Yes
Description:


The character '$', which may legitimately appear within symbol names
(and is used extensively within JVM type names), is also a regexp
metacharacter, and must thus be escaped before it is used in a regular
expression such as those in code in $inv/java/daikon/split/*.
Otherwise, the source emitted for the splitter classes is faulty and
cannot be compiled.

> The Java letters include uppercase and lowercase ASCII Latin letters
> A-Z (\u0041-\u005a), and a-z (\u0061-\u007a), and, for historical
> reasons, the ASCII underscore (_, or \u005f) and dollar sign ($, or
> \u0024). The $ character should be used only in mechanically
> generated source code or, rarely, to access preexisting names on
> legacy systems.
