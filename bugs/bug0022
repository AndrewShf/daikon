Tool:         daikon-bug
Summary:      can't find invariants tree even though INV is set
Severity:     Lethal
Status:       Closed
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

When I run daikon-bug, I get the following error:

[/tmp]$ daikon-bug
daikon-bug: can't find invariants tree -- please set INV.

However, INV is set:

[/tmp]$ echo $INV
/g5/users/mharder/research/invariants


- Spent ages trying to figure out why it worked fine for me then I
  realised that I had already fixed it a while ago and not checked it
  in.  Sorry dude. [adonovan]

- Closed. [mharder]
