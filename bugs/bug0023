Owner:        Jeremy <mistere>
Tool:         Daikon
Summary:      RFE: Report variables all equal to same constant directly; do no report equal to selves and one is constant.
Severity:     RFE
Status:       New
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

If the invariants "x == 5" and "y == 5" are true, Daikon should (for
ease of use) report
  x == 5
  y == 5
instead of
  x == y
  x == 5

That is, it should report equal to a constant directly; it should not report
variables equal to others when they are both constants.
