Summary:      VarInfoName does target class loading, this is evil.
Severity:     Vexing
Status:       New
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

During the PrintInvariants phase, VarInfoName.resolve{Field,Type} does
Class.forName on classes of the target program. This is evil because
(1) it's not target-language neutral, so it won't work with C++ etc,
and (b) it has unpleasant side effects, most notably that the target
class' <clinit> is executed which causes daikon.Runtime.setDtrace to
trample all over the trace file you just spent the last 52 minutes
collecting.

Why do we need it?
