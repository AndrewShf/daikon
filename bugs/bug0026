Tool:         dtrace-diff.pl
Summary:      Warning: Argument "uninit" isn't numeric in subtraction
Severity:     Boneheaded
Status:       New
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

When I run the dfec test named "test", dtrace-diff.pl gives the
following warnings:

dtrace-diff.pl test.decls test.dtrace test.dtrace.ideal > test.dtrace.diff
Argument "uninit" isn't numeric in subtraction (-) at /g5/users/mharder/research/invariants/scripts/dtrace-diff.pl line 138, <DTB> line 198.
Argument "uninit" isn't numeric in subtraction (-) at /g5/users/mharder/research/invariants/scripts/dtrace-diff.pl line 138, <DTB> line 198.

These were revealed when Mike changed the dtrace-diff.pl script so
warnings are enabled.  The code should be changed to eliminate these
warnings.
