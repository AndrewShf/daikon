Summary:      Two warnings running dtrace-diff.pl on Space test
Severity:     Boneheaded
Status:       Closed
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

I get two warnings when running dtrace-diff.pl on the Space test in
dfec tests:

Deep recursion on subroutine "main::getline" at /SDG/g1/users/daikonbuildtest/build/20020321-040000/invariants/scripts/dtrace-diff.pl line 28, <DECLS> line 17994.

Argument "nan" isn't numeric in subtraction (-) at /SDG/g1/users/daikonbuildtest/build/20020321-040000/invariants/scripts/dtrace-diff.pl line 147, <DTB> line 6589281.

As with bug0026, these warnings appear since Mike E. turned on
warnings in the script.  The code should be changed to eliminate these
warnings.

This appears to be fixed.  Closing.
