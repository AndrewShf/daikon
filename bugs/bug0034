Summary:      Some invariants not printing for ENTER program points in IOA
Severity:     Boneheaded
Status:       New
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

(Jeremy and I have talked about this already; this is just to put the
ideas in writing)

ENTER program points in IOA have very few variables with modbits set
(in particular, only variables that were function arguments).  Thus,
some equality invariants, like pc[turn] = pc[p] (see
~tohn/research/IOA_Toolkit/Examples/Peterson) do not appear, even
though they appear in Daikon 2 and in the exit program points.

What is the proper solution though?  What does it mean for something's
modbit to be set at the ENTER program point?  What does it mean in
IOA?
