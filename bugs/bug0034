Summary:      Some invariants not printing for ENTER program points in IOA
Severity:     Boneheaded

Description:

[mistere]
This is more Mike's area of expertise, so I'll add him to the owner list.
I also clarified some text below.

(Jeremy and I have talked about this already; this is just to put the
ideas in writing)

ENTER program points in IOA have very few variables with modbits set
(in particular, only variables that were function arguments).  Thus,
some equality invariants, like pc[turn] = pc[p] do not appear, even
though they appear in Daikon 2 and in the exit program points (see
~tohn/research/IOA_Toolkit/Examples/Peterson).

In V3, it is supressed due to few modified samples.  In V2, this
wasn't an issue because equivalence classes were established without
regard for the few missing samples check.

What is the proper solution though?  Simply ignoring this test for
equality may fix this problem, but if few variables are modified on
entry, it may cause other less-noticable problems for IOA traces.  In
short, what does it mean for something's modbit to be set at the ENTER
program point?  What does it mean in IOA?
