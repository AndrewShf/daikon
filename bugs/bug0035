Summary:      dfej does not instrument this.class
Severity:     Vexing
Status:       New
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

[mistere]
While dfej instruments the 'this' Object, it does not output the
correponding runtime type 'this.class'.  I believe that it should.
This information may be interesting for program understanding -- it
highlights when a method is defined in one class but used on another.

This may also suggest changes to inference.  If a class is final, or
we belive that it has no descendants (e.g. we didn't instrument any),
the obvious invariant on any of class Foo's program points
("this.class == Foo") should be supressed.

If we decide against this change, we need to fix the assertion
<VarInfo.java:564>  Assert.assert(a_class != null);
