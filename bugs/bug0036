Tool:         dfej
Summary:      3 versions of the manual are inconsistent
Severity:     RFE
Status:       New
Reproducible: Dunno
Description:

The DFEJ usage message, nroff manual page and HTML manual are all
inconsistent.  We should be using a single source to generate all
three.  Could be a fun piece of Perl hacking for when someone has a
free moment.
