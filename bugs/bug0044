Summary:      lh has bug with "_element" and "_index" for struct pointers
Severity:     Vexing
Status:       New
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

When lh instruments a pointer "*a", it adds the variables a_element
and a_index to the code.  Also, expressions involving "*a" are
replaced with expressions involving "*a" and possibly "a_element" and
"a_index".  These variables are added so we can determine lackwit
comparability of the elements and indices of the array.

However, lh isn't doing this correctly for struct pointers.  The
"_element" and "_index" variables are added as parameters, but
expressions involving the struct pointer aren't changed to use the
parameters.

To reproduce, run lh on the lackwit-structs.c test.  Look at
lackwit-structs.int.c, and compare struct_ptr_field_assign and
call_struct_ptr_field_assign to int_ptr and call_int_ptr.
