Summary:      Inner classes do not output OBJECT data upon constructor exit (or maybe not at all)
Severity:     Vexing
Status:       New
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

[mistere]
I have evidence that non-static inner classes do not output an OBJECT
sample upon constructor exit.  This may also hold true for static
inner classes, or for other methods besides the constructor.

The test case is $inv/tests/daikon-tests/MapQuick in the class
MapQuick2.CompositeRoute$Cons.  You can change the Makefile to only
instrument the one class if you like.  Just reading the instrumented
source shows that, upon exit of the Cons constructor, no OBJECT sample
is written to the dtrace file.
