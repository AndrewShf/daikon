Tool:         MergeESC
Summary:      Inner class constructor invariants are not merged
Severity:     Vexing
Status:       Closed
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

[amdunn]
The test case now works. I also tried it on a case I assembled and
it worked.

The problem was that inner class constructors have an implicit parameter
which is of the type of their enclosing class. Correcting the method
signature in getParameters of Ast.java fixed the problem.

[mistere]
MergeESC is failing to merge requires and ensures clauses for inner
class constructors.  I suspect it is a program point name matching
problem.

The test case is MapQuick.  Edit the Makefile to only instrument the
PriorityQueue class.  PriorityQueue$Entry is the problematic inner
class.  The precondition "value != null" is in the txt-daikon output
but is not merged.
