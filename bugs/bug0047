Tool:         MergeESC
Summary:      Inner class constructor invariants are not merged
Severity:     Vexing
Status:       New
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

[mistere]
MergeESC is failing to merge requires and ensures clauses for inner
class constructors.  I suspect it is a program point name matching
problem.

The test case is MapQuick.  Edit the Makefile to only instrument the
PriorityQueue class.  PriorityQueue$Entry is the problematic inner
class.  The precondition "value != null" is in the txt-daikon output
but is not merged.
