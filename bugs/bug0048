Summary:      dfec produces bad output when a local variable shadows a global one
Severity:     Vexing
Status:       New
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

dfec produces incorrect decls, dtrace files when a local variable
shadows a global one.  The correct behavior is to output only the
variable that can actually be seen.  To reproduce, look at
tot_info.decls in $inv/tests/dfec-tests/tot_info.  At the
"std.InfoTbl" program point, both "f" and "::f" are in the decls file.
Only "f" should be in the decls file, since "::f" is shadowed at this
program point.
