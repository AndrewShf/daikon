Tool:         bugtrack
Summary:      bugtrack's not documented
Severity:     RFE
Status:       Fixed
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

Fixed.  The UNIX manual page and the HTML introduction have both been
updated. [adonovan].

When you have a change, it'd be worthwhile to add into to the "new to
PAG" instructions telling people to checkout the bugs module.  (Also
add how to read the manpage, too?). The doc is here:
