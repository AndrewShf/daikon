Summary:      The dkconfig system should not use defaults.txt
Severity:     RFE
Status:       Closed
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

[mistere]
All of changes I recommended for myself below have been implemented.

[mistere]
The dkconfig system (daikon.config package) currently contains a
defaults.txt file that is automatically loaded to set defaults for all
dkconfig variables.  This is a poor system for a number of reasons

(1) duplication; a value may be set in the inializer (or, worse, by
java's defaults) which may vary from the defaults.txt setting

(2) mis-use; it encourages people to simply edit defaults.txt, which
isn't the right thing to do.

(3) loading first; loading defaults.txt first turns out to be
cumbersome, because it loads classes that may depend on it.

I believe that it would be better to eliminate defaults.txt completely
and specify the default value near the code that declares the field,
either with the declare-and-assign syntax, or with a static code
region (both get compiled to the same bytecode).

The config doclet should probably also be updated to print the default
value after the description.
