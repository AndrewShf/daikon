Summary:      Filtering on variables doesn't work sometimes
Severity:     Boneheaded
Status:       New
Reproducible: Yes
Description:

Say we can filter on variables {a, b, c}.  In the TreeGUI, select to
filter on them.  Then on top of that, select to filter on {a, b}.
This adds a total of 5 variable filters.  Then remove {a} from the
filtered var list.  Then try to remove {a} again and we get an
exception and {a} doesn't go away.
