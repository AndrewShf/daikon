Summary:      Anonymous implementations of interfaces do not correctly handle variables in scope.
Severity:     Boneheaded
Status:       New
Reproducible: Yes
Description:  

Implementing an interface anonymously within a method produces instrumented code that does not compile.  See ~smeghani/samirbugs/AnonymousSomeInterfaceImpl.java for an example.  The instrumented code creates a constructor with the correct arguments, but should make no explicit call to super(..).  The call to the constructor does not contain the correct arguments.
