.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Bugtrack is a simple bug-tracking database.  It is a veneer over CVS, and 
uses one file per report, named
.IR bugXXXX ,
(where 
.I XXXX
is the bug-report's numeric ID). 
.TP
.B new
Create a new report. The program will prompt for various required fields,
then invoke the user's editor for the description field.
The owner(s) of the bug-report are sent notification by email.
.TP
.B list
List a brief summary of all live bug reports.
.PP
.B owned
List a brief summary of all bugs owned by the current user,
.BR $USER .
.TP
\fBshow \fIn\fR
Show in full the bug report whose ID is
.IR n ;
(equivalent to \fIcvs up; more bug<n>\fR).
.TP
.B edit \fIn\fR
Edit the bug report whose ID is 
.IR n .
The owner(s) of the bug-report are sent notification by email.
.TP
.B del \fIn\fR
Delete the bug report whose ID is
.IR n ;
Do not use this for closing a bug report; use
.B edit
instead, and change the status to
.IR closed .
.SS Usage Tips
The
.I owner
of a report defaults to the user that created it, but any number of
people can be named as owners; this allows the person reporting the
bug to "share" it with other users who have responsibility for it.
Users that simply want to know about progress fixing the bug should be
added to the 
.I Cc 
list.  The creator of a bug report should usually be one of
the owners.
.PP
When a mod is made to fix a bug, the person applying the fix should
not close the bug report but mark it as
.BR fixed ;
the original creator should close the report once they have verified the
fix.
.PP
When making changes to a bug report, unless you are the owner and sole
editor, put your username at the end of the new description, and use a
bullet point to start your text.
