History of Daikon changes

This file lists significant user-visible changes to Daikon.  (Many other
changes are not noted here.)  For documentation of Daikon, see the Daikon
manual.  Its source is file daikon.texinfo; formatted, it appears as
daikon.html, daikon.info, daikon.dvi, daikon.ps, or daikon.pdf.

===========================================================================

2.3.13 (17 July 2002):

Fix bug when running from daikon.jar.

Improvements to detection of floating-point invariants.

Manual gives example of use of orig variables, explains what to do when
Daikon runs slowly, discusses Ajax "too many levels of symbolic links"
error.
 
2.3.12 (11 July 2002):

Daikon reports invariants over floating-point numbers.  Previously, it
silently ignored floating-point numbers.

2.3.11 (9 July 2002):

The runcluster.pl program performs cluster analysis (a machine learning
technique) to produce splitter info files.  This is in addition to other
ways of producing splitter info files, such as static analysis or writing
them by hand.

The .decls file format now supports auxiliary information for declared
types.  It can indicate that a collection never contains duplicates or that
order does not matter (both useful for avoiding obvious invariants over
sets), properties of null in a collection, and whether a variable is a
call-by-value parameter (and so can never change, from the point of view of
the caller).  Use of this information reduces Daikon's output.

The manual emphasizes that dfec only works on ANSI/ISO C programs (that are
also legal C++ programs), and gives a number of hints for making your C
programs compliant.

2.3.10 (10 June 2002):

Bugfix release.

2.3.9 (4 June 2002):

Improve dfec documentation: explain more error messages (including array
bounds errors), add gcc installation instructions, explain uninitialized
array element processing.
 
2.3.8 (10 May 2002):

This release coordinates with a new release of the dfec binaries (at
http://pag.lcs.mit.edu/daikon/download/).

Remove some innocuous syntax anachronisms from example C programs.
Add the example C programs to the distribution.
Add manual section describing the example C programs.
Improve dfec documentation in the manual.
The Context GUI now supports C programs.

Rearrange distribution to avoid very long file names in tar file.

2.3.7 (1 May 2002):

Rewrite of dfec documentation.  dfec is now easier to use, more robust, and
supports new options, such as struct instrumentation depth.

Remove incorrect dfej documentation for "-instrsourcedir=.".

Add documentation for CreateSpinfo program.

Add new configuration options daikon.split.FileCompiler.compiler and
daikon.split.TimedProcess.compile_wait.

2.3.6 (5 April 2002):

MergeESC tool inserts Daikon output into Java source files as ESC/Java
comments.

Invariant Diff can compute set difference, union, and xor.  It can produce
output in the new InvMap format, and can read that format.  New flags
enable specification of custom comparators.

dfej's "-daikon-omit" flag can be a regular expression.

Daikon takes a --config_option flag to specify configuration settings.

Ajax tool bug fixes.

Improved installation and troubleshooting instructions.

2.3.5 (1 March 2002):

Add --files_from command-line argument to Daikon.

Add -a and -l command-line arguments to Diff.

2.3.4 (17 February 2002):

Add four new programs to the distribution:
  createspinfo.pl trace-untruncate trace-purge-fns.pl trace-purge-vars.pl

Manual enhancements:
 * Add section on configuration options.
 * Add paragraph about debugging options.
 * Add text about two new GUI filters.
 * Typo fixes.

2.3.3 (11 February 2002):

Add new flags to Diff program.

Manual enhancements:
 * Fix errors with "-noajax" flag in manual.
 * Describe redundant invariants and how to print them.
 * Explain format of Java program point names.
 * Explain more invariant (Daikon output) syntax. 
 * Indicate deal with errors in the external Ajax and Simplify programs.

----------------

2.3.2 (7 December 2001):

Support for splitter files that specify conditions to use when detecting
implications (conditional invariants).

Daikon's --config option permits reading and saving sets of configuration
options.

The Daikon Java runtime respects the DTRACEAPPEND environment variable.

dfec requires that gcc be present.

----------------

2.3.1 (8 October 2001):

Added Context GUI, which shows relevant invariants in a separate window as
you browse code in a text editor.

Added many index entries to manual.

----------------

2.3.0 (11 September 2001):

Added linear ternary invariants, of the form z = ax + by + c.
