2.3.6 (5 April 2002):

MergeESC tool inserts Daikon output into Java source files as ESC/Java
comments.

Invariant Diff can compute set difference, union, and xor.  It can produce
output in the new InvMap format, and can read that format.  New flags
enable specification of custom comparators.

dfej's "-daikon-omit" flag can be a regular expression.

Daikon takes a --config_option flag to specify configuration settings.
