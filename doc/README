In this directory (~mernst/research/notkin/invariants/):

 * notes: my (organized and disorganized) notes
 * examples-notes: notes about test inputs (separated from notes file above)
 * invariants.bib: notes on related work
 * cubist/ and foil/:  experiments with machine learning programs
 * invariants.py, util.py: the invariant detector, implemented in Python
 * gries.lisp:  the programs from David Gries' book (in Lisp syntax)
 * gries-helper.lisp, data-trace.lisp:  Gries Lisp syntax; output data to file
 * p*.dtrace: files created by running instrumented Gries programs
 * *.discovered: output from running invariant engine over .dtrace files

Example programs:
 * medic/: files related to the Medic planner (my instrumented Lisp program)
    * medic/found-invariants-980523: sample output of my invariant detector
    * medic/data/: logs created by the instrumentation and read by the
      invariant detector; you are only interested in .inv files
 * rothermel/: adaptations of Siemens test programs; from Gregg Rothermel
 * edg/: EDG C/C++ front end version 2.38
