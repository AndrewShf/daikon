<h3><a name="intro"> Introduction </a></h3>

By default, Daikon outputs a long textual list of invariants.  Sometimes one is
overwhelmed by the sheer number of invariants.  The graphical user interface (GUI)
designed to make the task of browsing invariants easier.  The GUI contains a tree which
hierarchically organizes program points according to their class and method.  Using the
GUI, you can look at invariants for only the methods and program points you care about.
You can also sort invariants by a property (eg, probability) or filter invariants (eg,
only look at invariants containing a certain variable). <p>


<h3><a name="start"> Starting up the GUI </a></h3>

To use the GUI, first make a <tt>.inv</tt> file by invoking Daikon with the <tt>-o</tt>
option; to create <tt>foo.inv</tt>, you would do

<pre>    java daikon.Daikon -o <em>foo</em>.inv <em>decl-files...</em> <em>trace-files...</em></pre>

Then, run the GUI with the <tt>.inv</tt> file as an argument:

<pre>    java daikon.gui.InvariantsGUI foo.inv</pre>


<h3><a name="use"> Using the GUI </a></h3>

The GUI consists of three sections.  At the very top we have the control panel.  Use the
control panel to control what invariants are displayed.  For example, checking the "Show
unjustified invariants" checkbox will display justified <u>and</u> unjustified
invariants. <p>

Under the control panel, we have the Ppt tree -- a hierarchy of program points broken down
by class and method.  Click on various program points in the tree to see tables of
invariants for those program points.  You may use the <tt>Ctrl</tt> and <tt>Shift</tt>
keys to make an arbitrary selection of program points.  Selecting a class or method will
automatically select all the Ppt's associated with that method or class. <p>

At the bottom of the GUI, we have the invariant tables panel.  A table will be displayed
for each program point that is selected in the Ppt tree.  Use <tt>Alt</tt> along with the
or down arrow keys to scroll through the tables.  You can sort a column in a table by
clicking on the column header.  Shift-click to sort the column in reverse order. <p>
