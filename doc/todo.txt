Outstanding Issues

  jhp     10/30/03      Fix invariant documentation

    The invariant documentation now includes versions for each permutation
    of each FunctionBinary function.   This needs to be changed to not
    show a separate class for each function

  jhp     10/30/03      Add documentation for --track switch.  

    Probably should add this to V2 as well.

  jhp     10/30/03      --track should do some error checking

    It would be nice if --track could do some sort of error checking.
    It should also only print out the tracked vars once, rather than after
    each --track switch.

  jhp     10/30/03      finish check_vs_global() checking

    check_vs_global makes sure there are no invariants that exist both
    locally and at the global ppt.  It is called after adding samples
    in PptTopLevel. This should be uncommented and any remaining problems
    (which are few) fixed.

  jhp     10/23/03      Global ppt needs to handle derived variables

    The code that creates the relation between global variables at a ppt
    and the global ppt doesn't handle derived variables correctly.  This
    should use the same basic approach as in PptRelation.  Its not causing
    a problem for now because flex doesn't enable derived variables

  jhp     09/02/03      Orig variables are not always found at exit point

    There is an assert in PptRelation.newEnterExitRel() that should be 
    turned back on.  Fix the resulting errors in the regression tests.

  jhp      09/02/03     Add comparability check when creating binary slices

    Comparability is not checked when creating binary slices since we 
    creates slices between arrays and integers.  This can be fixed to
    properly check comparability before creating the slice

   jhp     09/02/03     Fix comments in SuppressionLink.java

     SuppressionLink.java says:

      * Connects one Invariant to a set of suppressor invariants;
      * immutable.

     but also:

       /**
        * What stage of use this link is in.  Gets modified.  Can be one of
        * CREATED, LINKED or UNLINKED.
        **/
       private int state = CREATED;

     Which is right?

     And SuppressionLink.java also says:

        Each
      * SuppressionLink is connected to exactly ONE invariant on each side.

     but later:

       private final List suppressors;

     so this needs to be clarified as well.
