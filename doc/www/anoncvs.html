<h1>Anonymous CVS for the Daikon project</h1>

There are two modules (directories) available via anonymous CVS from
pag.csail.mit.edu:  <tt>invariants</tt> (the bulk of the Daikon invariant
detection system, which is written in Java) and <tt>dfej</tt> (the Daikon
front end for Java, which is written in C++).
<p>

To obtain the <tt>invariants</tt> module, execute the following commands.  They
create an <tt>invariants</tt> subdirectory in the current directory.  Use
the password <tt>research</tt>.

<pre>
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@pag.csail.mit.edu:/g4/projects/invariants/.CVS login
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@pag.csail.mit.edu:/g4/projects/invariants/.CVS co invariants
</pre>
<p>

Optionally, to obtain the <tt>dfej</tt> module, execute the following
commands.  They create a <tt>dfej</tt> subdirectory in the current
directory.  Use the password <tt>research</tt>.

<pre>
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@pag.csail.mit.edu:/g4/projects/invariants/.CVS login
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@pag.csail.mit.edu:/g4/projects/invariants/.CVS co dfej
</pre>
<p>

After executing these commands, you should be able to issue CVS commands
such as
<pre>
  cvs update
</pre>
to update your copy of the repository from the master version.
<p>

Be sure to read over the "Installing Daikon" section of the Daikon User
Manual for details on setting your classpath and the like.
<p>

Also, you may find the internal MIT instructions in directory
<tt>invariants/doc/www/mit/</tt> helpful in building Daikon.
Also note that there are two sets of tests:  the (small) "unit
tests" in <tt>invariants/java/daikon/test/</tt> and the (large) "system
tests" in <tt>invariants/tests</tt>.
