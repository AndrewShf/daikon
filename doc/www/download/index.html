<h1>Daikon invariant detector distribution</h1>

This is the distribution site for the Daikon invariant
detector.<br>
The current release is Daikon version 4.1.5, released September 1, 2005.
(<a href="doc/CHANGES">CHANGES file</a>)
<p>

In addition to the below downloads, also see the
<a href="doc/">documentation</a> and the
<a href="../mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a>.
<p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Daikon distribution</b>:  This is everything most people need to
    get started with invariant detection.<br>
    Choose a format (both have the same contents):
    <ul>
      <li>Gzipped tar file: <a href="daikon.tar.gz">daikon.tar.gz</a> (1 May 2005, 16 Mbytes)
      <li>Zip file: <a href="daikon.zip">daikon.zip</a> (1 May 2005, 19 Mbytes)
    </ul>
      Download either the tar file or the zip file, whichever you prefer.
      The Daikon distribution includes everything you need to start using
      Daikon:  source files, compiled files (including <a
      href="daikon.jar">daikon.jar</a>), documentation, examples, and more.
    <p>
  <li><b>Front ends</b><br>
    A <a href="doc/daikon.html#Front-ends">front end</a> enables Daikon to
    work on a specific programming language, such as Java, C/C++, or Perl.
    Most people find that all the front ends that they need for
    their work
    (including front ends for Java, C, Perl, and other languages) are
    provided in the Daikon distribution.  Here we provide additional
    downloads for unusual circumstances.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Java front end, <tt>Chicory</tt></b><br>
        Sources for Chicory, the front end for Java, are included with
        Daikon, and you don't have to download any additional files or do
        any other installation in order to use it.
      <li><b>C/C++ front end, <tt>Kvasir</tt></b><br>
        Sources for Kvasir, the front end for C binaries, are included in
        the distribution.  You should build Kvasir yourself from the
        sources, which is easy to do; see <a
	href="doc/daikon.html#Installing-Kvasir">"Installing Kvasir"</a> in
        the Daikon manual.
      <li><b>C/C++ front end, <tt>mangel-wurzel</tt></b><br>
	The mangel-wurzel front end for C/C++ source code is an
	alternative to Kvasir.  It can work on essentially any platform,
        but using this front end requires that
	you purchase and install <a
        href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/purify/">Rational
        Purify</a>.
	<br>
	License restrictions prevent us from distributing source for the 
        mangel-wurzel front end.  Send mail to <a
	href="mailto:daikon-developers@lists.csail.mit.edu">daikon-developers@pag.csail.mit.edu</a> to
	request a binary for another system if it is not on this list.
        <br>
	The mangel-wurzel distribution is a tar file containing prebuilt
	binary; see 
	<a href="doc/daikon.html#Installing-Mangel_002dWurzel">"Installing mangel-wurzel"</a> in the Daikon manual.
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="binaries/mangel-wurzel-linux-x86.tar.gz">x86 Debian Linux</a> (31 Aug 2005)
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
<!--
  <li><b>Eclipse plug-in</b>: 
     The Daikon plug-in for Eclipse provides the
      functionality of instrumenting files, obtaining trace information,
      analyzing those traces, and creating appropriately annotated Java
      source code.
      See the Daikon plug-in <a href="doc/daikonHelp.html">documentation</a> for <a
      href="doc/daikonHelp.html#Installation">installation instructions</a>.
      The plug-in documentation is also available through the Eclipse Help
      facility, and source code is publicly available.<br>
      <b>Warning</b>:  The plug-in works with Daikon version 4.1.5, not Daikon
      version 4.  Until the plug-in is ported to Daikon version 4, we
      recommend use of the command-line tools, rather than the plug-in.
    <p>
-->
  <li><b>CVS</b>:  Daikon is also available via CVS; see the <a
      href="doc/developer.html#Historical">Daikon Developer Manual</a> for
      details.  One feature of the CVS repository is a set of <a
      href="doc/developer.html#Testing">regression
      tests</a>.  (Full source code for Daikon, and unit tests, are
      included in the main distribution, but the full regression tests are
      not, for reasons of size.)

</ul>

<p>
As an alternative to downloading Daikon, members of the Daikon project may
use their csail.mit.edu accounts to access the Daikon source directly.
See the <a href="../mit/">instructions for using Daikon at MIT CSAIL</a>.
