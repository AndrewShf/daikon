<h2><a name="What_is_Daikon?">What is Daikon?</a></h2>

Daikon is an <em>invariant detector</em>.  Given a data source (such as the
values computed by a program at runtime), Daikon generalizes over the
observed values and reports properties that are true about the data.
Daikon implements a type of machine learning to summarize the raw data into
a small set of easily comprehensible formulas.


<h2><a name="What_is_an_operational_abstraction?">What is an operational abstraction?</a></h2>

The set of formulas that Daikon outputs is called an <em>operational
abstraction</em>.  The operational abstraction states properties about a
program's data structures -- the sort that might be written in an
<tt>assert</tt> statement or a formal specification.
<p>

Here is a simple example of Daikon's output:  <a
href="StackAr.html">StackAr.html</a>.  The colored annotations starting
with "<FONT COLOR="red"><tt>@</tt></FONT>" were automatically detected by
Daikon and automatically inserted in the source code.  Many other uses for
invariants are possible in addition to insertion as documentation.
<p>


<h2><a name="What_is_an_operational_abstraction_good_for?">What is an operational abstraction good for?</a></h2>

Program properties such as specifications are useful for a wide variety of
software construction, understanding, reuse, and modification tasks.  
Some example uses of invariants are:
<ul>
  <li>Document code, indicating the structure of its data and computation
  <li>Check assumptions by converting the invariants to <tt>assert</tt>
      statements.
  <li>Maintain invariants to avoid introducing bugs; if a property is
      established at one point in a program, it is likely to be depended on
      elsewhere, but if the invariant is not documented, it is all to easy
      to accidentally violate it, introducing a bug in a far-removed part
      of the program.
  <li>Locate unusual conditions that should be brought to a programmer's
      attention and may be bugs.
  <li>Validate test suites by indicating the level of value coverage which
      indicates how many different values are computed; this complements
      code coverage, which tells how many lines are executed.
  <li>Provide hints for profile-directed compilation, but at the level of
      the program abstractions, permitting entire function calls to
      possibly be omitted after a check.
  <li>Bootstrap proofs and aid static checkers by providing goals and
      automating the time-consuming, tedious chore of annotating programs.
</ul>
<p>


<h2><a name="How_is_an_operational_abstraction_used?">How is an operational abstraction used?</a></h2>

An operational abstraction can be used automatically, in which case a human
never directly examines it, or both automatically and manually, in which
case a human does examine (parts of) it.  A number of automatic uses are
discussed in the <a href="pubs/">research papers</a> that use Daikon.
<p>

As an example of manual use of Daikon, a programmer might run it on a
program and see, at a procedure entry,
<pre>
  w >= 0
  x < 10
  y = w + x
  z = 0 (mod 4)
</pre>
(These examples are all numeric for simplicity, but Daikon detects
relationships over general data structures, including arrays, collections,
and pointers.)
<ul>
<li>
Seeing the "w >= 0" invariant, the programmer might remark, "I already knew
that w is non-negative; that doesn't help me any."  (However, examining
this invariant consumes little of the programmer's time.)
<li>
Seeing the "x < 10" invariant, the programmer might realize after a
moment's thought that the test suite is deficient:  it never manipulates
data structures containing more than 9 elements.  This invariant has
indicated not only a problem with the test suite, but exactly how to fix
it.
<li>
Seeing the "y = w + x" invariant, the programmer might suddenly understand
the operation of the algorithm or why certain parts of the program are
coded in the way they are.  This can prevent long sessions of puzzlement
over the system, and inserting the invariant as a comment can prevent
others from going through the same confusion.
<li>
Seeing the "z = 0 (mod 4)" invariant, the programmer might be confused
about why z is always a multiple of 4.  The programmer has two options.
<ol>
  <li>
The programmer can examine the program and test
   suite to understand why this is so.  (Perhaps z holds a pointer value or
   is some other kind of specialized index; perhaps it is a capacity that
   is always increased by a multiple of 4; perhaps there is some odd
   property of the test suite.)  This gives the programmer a much better
   understanding of the operation of the program.
  <li>
The other option is for the programmer not to investigate this property
   further -- perhaps it is not directly relevant to the current task --
   but to be careful not to make changes that violate that property.
   Violating the property could introduce errors if other parts of the code
   depend on it.
</ol>
</ul>


<h2><a name="How_accurate_is_Daikon?">How accurate is Daikon?</a></h2>

The Daikon system examines the values computed during the target program's
execution, looking for patterns and relationships among those values.
There are two potential problems:  missing properties (false negatives),
and spurious properties (false positives).
<p>

False negatives are inevitable, because every tool has a grammar that
limits what it can express.  Daikon has a relatively simple and broadly
applicable grammar.  Users can extend it easily, by writing a Java class
that satisfies an interface with four methods.
<p>

False positives can also occur; the properties are not guaranteed to hold
for every possible execution.  As with any other dynamic (run-time)
technique, such as testing, the results depend on the quality of the test
suite.  In practice, the results have proved to be quite accurate even with
very modest test suites, thanks to statistical tests that weed out most
false positives.  And research has shown that the inaccuracies can help in
improving test suites.
<p>


<h2><a name="What_does_the_name_Daikon_mean?">What does the name Daikon mean?</a></h2>

A daikon is a type of Asian radish.  Daikon is pronounced like the two
English words die-con.  The name can be thought of standing for "dynamic
conjectures".

<h2><a name="How_can_I_get_help?">How can I get help?</a></h2>

If you have questions about using Daikon, first read the
<a href="download/doc/">Daikon manual</a>, including the "Troubleshooting" section.x
If you have questions about modifying Daikon, also see the 
<a href="download/doc/developer.html">Daikon developer manual</a>, the
<a href="download/jdoc/">Javadoc comments</a>, and the
source code.
<p>

If you do not find an answer in the documentation, or you think you have
found an error (bug), then use one of the
<a href="mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a> to get help from other
Daikon users and from the Daikon developers.  (See the manual for a
discussion of what information to include in your email in order to make it
most useful to its recipients, which maximizes your chances of receiving a
fast and relevant reply.
<p>


<h2><a name="How_can_I_help?">How can I help?</a></h2>

Daikon is a collaborative project.  Over two dozen programmers have
contributed code (and we gratefully accept new features and and bug fixes),
and many users have helped by making suggestions and filing problem reports
(whether about the code or the documentation).  Please give us feedback
through the <a href="mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a>, or just tell us how you
have used Daikon.
