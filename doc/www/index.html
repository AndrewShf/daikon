<p><a href="http://pag.csail.mit.edu/daikon/">Daikon</a> is an implementation of
dynamic detection of likely invariants; that is, the Daikon invariant
detector reports likely program invariants.  An invariant is a property
that holds at a certain point or points in a program; these are often
seen in assert statements, documentation, and formal specifications.
Invariants can be useful in program understanding and a host of other
applications.  Examples include "x.field &gt; abs(y)"; "y = 2*x+3"; "array
a is sorted"; "for all list objects lst, lst.next.prev = lst"; "for all
treenode objects n, n.left.value &lt; n.right.value"; "p != null =&gt;
p.content in myArray"; and many more.  You can extend Daikon to add new
properties.

   <p>Dynamic invariant detection runs a program, observes the values that the
program computes, and then reports properties that were true over the
observed executions.
<!-- Daikon's output, which is sometimes called an "operational abstraction", -->
<!-- looks like a formal specification, or the contents of assert statements. -->
Daikon can detect properties in Java,
C, C++, Perl, and IOA programs;
in spreadsheet files; and in other data sources:  dynamic invariant
detection is a machine learning technique that can be applied to
arbitrary data.  It is easy to extend Daikon to other applications; as
one example, an interface exists to the
<a href="http://javapathfinder.sourceforge.net/">Java PathFinder model checker</a>.

   <p>Daikon is freely available for download from

includes both source code and

and Daikon's license permits unrestricted use (see <a href="http://pag.csail.mit.edu/daikon/download/doc/daikon.html#License">License</a>).  Many
researchers and practitioners have used Daikon; those uses, and Daikon
itself, are described in various
