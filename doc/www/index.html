<h1>The Daikon invariant detector</h1>

Daikon (named after the Asian radish) is a prototype implementation of
dynamic invariant detection.  Front ends exist for Java and C/C++.

<h1>Dynamic invariant detection</h1>

This research aims to dynamically detect invariants about a program's data
structures -- the sort that might be written in an <tt>assert</tt>
statement or a formal specification.  Examples include a&gt;0, c=2*d+3, a
particular list or array is sorted, the child slots of treenode objects
point to objects whose parent slots point back at the original treenode,
and the like.  Such program properties are useful for a wide variety of
software construction, understanding, reuse, and modification tasks, but
they are usually absent from code.  Static techniques for determining
invariants break down in the presence of real-world constructs such as
pointers.  A complementary approach is to dynamically detect properties
from execution traces.<p>

The Daikon system examines the values computed during the target program's
execution, looking for patterns and relationships among those values.
These can be reported to the user or provided to another tool.  As with any
other dynamic technique, such as testing, the properties are not guaranteed
to hold for every possible execution; they depend on the quality of the
test suite.  In practice, the results are sufficiently accurate to be
useful despite their potential unsoundness; and the results are also
valuable for validating test suites.  See the published <a
href="#papers">papers</a> for more details.<p>

Some example uses of invariants are:
<ul>
  <li>Document code, indicating the structure of its data and computation
  <li>Check assumptions by converting the invariants to <tt>assert</tt>
      statements.
  <li>Maintain invariants to avoid introducing bugs; if a property is
      established at one point in a program, it is likely to be depended on
      elsewhere, but if the invariant is not documented, it is all to easy
      to accidentally violate it, introducing a bug in a far-removed part
      of the program.
  <li>Locate unusual conditions that should be brought to a programmer's
      attention and may be bugs.
  <li>Validate test suites by indicating the level of value coverage which
      indicates how many different values are computed; this complements
      code coverage, which tells how many lines are executed.
  <li>Provide hints for profile-directed compilation, but at the level of
      the program abstractions, permitting entire function calls to
      possibly be omitted after a check.
  <li>Bootstrap proofs and aid static checkers by providing goals and
      automating the time-consuming, tedious chore of annotating programs.
</ul>
<p>

As an example of Daikon's use, a programmer might run it on a program and
see, at a procedure entry,
<pre>
  w >= 0
  x < 10
  y = w + x
  z = 0 (mod 4)
</pre>
<ul>
<li>
Seeing the "w >= 0" invariant, the programmer might remark, "I already knew
that w is non-negative; that doesn't help me any."  (However, examining
this invariant consumes little of the programmer's time.)
<li>
Seeing the "x < 10" invariant, the programmer might realize after a
moment's thought that the test suite is deficient:  it never manipulates
data structures containing more than 9 elements.  This invariant has
indicated not only a problem with the test suite, but exactly how to fix
it.
<li>
Seeing the "y = w + x" invariant, the programmer might suddenly understand
the operation of the algorithm or why certain parts of the program are
coded in the way they are.  This can prevent long sessions of puzzlement
over the system, and inserting the invariant as a comment can prevent
others from going through the same confusion.
<li>
Seeing the "z = 0 (mod 4)" invariant, the programmer might be confused
about why z is always a multiple of 4.  The programmer has two options.
<ol>
  <li>
The programmer can examine the program and test
   suite to understand why this is so.  (Perhaps z holds a pointer value or
   is some other kind of specialized index; perhaps it is a capacity that
   is always increased by a multiple of 4; perhaps there is some odd
   property of the test suite.)  This gives the programmer a much better
   understanding of the operation of the program.
  <li>
The other option is for the programmer not to investigate this property
   further -- perhaps it is not directly relevant to the current task --
   but to be careful not to make changes that violate that property.
   Violating the property could introduce errors if other parts of the code
   depend on it.
</ol>
</ul>


Preliminary experiments have been very encouraging.  When provided with
formally specified programs, the prototype invariant detector, Daikon,
recovered the properties in the formal specifications (and even found some
properties that had been inadvertently omitted from the specifications).
In another experiment, programmers performing a software modification task
on a C program lacking explicit invariants were provided with the output of
the invariant detector.  They found that it aided program understanding,
revealed an existing bug, prevented them from introducing a bug, and helped
validate the correctness of their changes.<p>
