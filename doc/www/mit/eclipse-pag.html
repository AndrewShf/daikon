<h1>Eclipse Setup for PAG Members</h1>

<P>This guide tells you how to:

<ol>
<li><a href="#startup">Start up Eclipse on PAG machines</a>
<li><a href="#existing-projects">Work on Daikon and other existing coding projects in Eclipse</a>
<li><a href="#debugger">Use the Eclipse debugger</a>
<li><a href="#cvs">Use CVS with Eclipse</a>
</ol>

<h2><a name="startup">Start up Eclipse</a></h2>

<p>All the PAG machines should have Eclipse installed. You simply run
the command 'eclipse' at the command shell.</p>

<p>There is one big catch; take note of where you launch Eclipse and
ALWAYS launch Eclipse from the same location. For example, you might
want to alias run-eclipse with '<tt>cd $HOME; eclipse</tt>'.
For convenience, this is already done for you if you source the pag-daikon
startup scripts.
</P>

<P>There are ways around the launch location inconvenience, such as
the -data switch, but the alias trick should be the simplest and least
confusing workaround.</p>

<h2><a name="existing-projects">Work on existing coding projects</a></h2>

<p>(This is the most annoying and error prone part.  I will add screenshots
soon.)

<p>Before working on code in Eclipse, you must import the code into
the Eclipse workspace.  You also need to set up various compilation
settings and specify jars and classes that should be in the
compilation classpath.  (By default, Eclipse does not use your
environment Classpath.)</p>

<ol>
<li>Change to the Java perspective by selecting "Java Perspective" in
the perspective menu on the far-left tool panel.  You should see some
of the windows move around to a structure similar to the screenshot
below.  <br><br> 

<li> Select the menu item File->New->Project <br><br>

<li> On the popup window, select Java Project and click Next <br><br>

<li> Call the project 'Daikon' or some other appropriate name and
click Next.  <br><br> 

<li> On the next window, create a new folder in
the project called 'src', and answer Yes to the next dialog box asking
you to confirm a change in the build directory. Select Ok and you
should see the new Project as a small folder icon in the package
explorer.  <br><br> 

<li> Select the menu item File->Import <br><br>

<li> On the next popup window, select "File System" and click
Next. Browse to the folder containing your source code.  Using the
standard PAG setup, the folder should be $INV/java. The import
destination should be Daikon/src.  Check the boxes for including
daikon, jtb, and utilMDE.  <br><br>

<li> Finally, add the required jars for Daikon by right-clicking on
the project and selecting the Properties menu.
Select "Java Build Path", then "Libraries", then "Add External
Jars" and add tools.jar, junit.jar, jakarta-oro.jar, and
java-getopt.jar.  (See your CLASSPATH environment variable for full
pathnames to these files.)
</ol>

<h2><a name="debugger">Using the Eclipse debugger</a></h2>

<p>TODO, but pretty self-explanatory.

<h2><a name="cvs">Using CVS with Eclipse</a></h2>

<p>TODO, although you can just do all the editing, compiling, and
running from the Eclipse IDE while doing CVS commands from the shell
or whatever current system you use.
