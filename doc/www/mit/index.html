<h1>Using Daikon at MIT LCS</h1>

This document tells you how to get started using Daikon on the PAG machines
(all named after root vegetables) at the MIT Lab for Computer Science.
These steps are primarily for students and other colleagues working with
Michael Ernst; if you do not need access to the central repository of code
and data, you can simply <a href="../download">download</a> the Daikon
distribution to your own computer.

<p>
The steps are simple, but there are many of them.  You
might wish to print this out (along with the <a
href="../download/doc/daikon.html">Daikon manual</a>) and check off items as
you ensure that they are correct.
<p>

You should already be familiar with <a href="../">the Daikon homepage</a>
and <a href="../download/">the Daikon distribution</a>.  See the <a
href="../download/doc/daikon.html">Daikon manual</a> for more details.

<h3><a name="learning-about-daikon"></a>Learning about Daikon</h3>

In order to become familiar with the theory of dynamic invariant detection
and some details of the Daikon implementation, see the following <a
href="http://pag.lcs.mit.edu/~mernst/research/#Invariant%20detection">papers</a>:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://pag.lcs.mit.edu/~mernst/pubs/invariants-tse-abstract.html">Dynamically
      Discovering Likely Program Invariants to Support Program
      Evolution</a> (IEEE TSE, v27#2, Feb 2001, pp 1-25)<br>
      I call this "the invariants paper" as it was the first exposition of
      the idea of dynamic invariant detection.  The first four and last
      three sections are more important than the middle four; you might
      want to skim the latter if you are short on time.
  <li><a href="http://pag.lcs.mit.edu/~mernst/pubs/invariants-icse2000-abstract.html">Quickly Detecting Relevant Program Invariants</a> (ICSE 2000)<br>
      I call this "the relevance paper"; it discusses essential
      improvements to the basic technique.
</ul>
There are additional papers that further discuss the technique and
its applications; which ones to read depends on your particular interest.

You should perform your work on one of these client machines
(listed from fastest to slowest):  
  parsnip, peanut,
  beet, daikon, manioc, rutabaga, turnip,
  scallion, yam,
  shallot, cassava, potato,
  meoptiplex.
All of the client machines use the
pag.lcs.mit.edu (alternately known as geyer.lcs.mit.edu) filesystem, which has
plenty of disk space and direct access to the main CVS repository and
precompiled binaries.  (You should not work on pag itself, which is a
file server, mail server, etc.  It is polite to avoid running
compute-intensive jobs on a machine that someone else is currently using;
for instance, if you have your ssh-agent credentials set up, you can find
out which machines are not currently in use via
<tt>~mernst/bin/share/pagdo uptime</tt> or <tt>~mernst/bin/share/pagdo
myxloads</tt>.)
<p>

Do not use standard telnet or rlogin to log into the machines remotely;
always use ssh.  Similarly, for file transfer, use anonymous means or use
scp.  The ssh and scp programs protect your password from eavesdroppers; we
don't want our machines to get broken into due to negligence.  To change
your password, use the <tt>yppasswd</tt> command; do not use plain
<tt>passwd</tt>.
<p>

Ask <a href="mailto:mernst@lcs.mit.edu">Michael Ernst</a> or someone else
with sysadmin privileges to make you an account; be sure to specify the
username you prefer.  Only that person needs to know the <a
href="pag-account.html">details of account creation</a>.
<p>

When you log in, you will encounter an error in your initial
<tt>.bashrc</tt> or <tt>.cshrc</tt> until you <a href="#local-cvs">check
out your copy of the CVS repository</a>.
<p>


<!-- All this is taken care of automatically; don't mention them here, in
order to avoid overloading readers.
-->

<!-- <h2><a name="environment-1"></a>Setting up your environment (part 1, before installing Daikon)</h2>


Mail to <em>yourusername</em>@pag.lcs.mit.edu will be forwarded according
to the contents of your <tt>.forward</tt> file, which you may change if you
like.<p>

It is important that you be a member of the "invariants" Unix group.  (Run
the command <tt>groups</tt> to see which ones you are in.)  If you are not
in these groups, you cannot access the CVS repository.<p>

To make CVS produce diffs in "unified format", and to make CVS create
directories that exist in the repository but are missing from the working
directory, create a file in your home directory named <tt>.cvsrc</tt>
containing the following contents:
<blockquote>
<pre>
diff -u
update -d -P
</pre>
</blockquote>
or just <a href=".cvsrc">download this one</a> to your home directory.
<p>

If you wish to run <tt>dfej</tt> on a PAG machine, then you will need to
adjust your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.  A reasonable setting
(csh syntax; this would go in your <tt>.cshrc</tt> file) is
<blockquote>
<pre>
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH   /usr/X11R6/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib:/lib
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

Stable versions of both <tt>dfej</tt> and <tt>dfec</tt> (the Daikon Front
End for Java) appear in 
<tt>~mernst/research/invariants/binaries</tt>.  You should put that
directory on your path or make links to those binaries from a directory on
your path.  (The development version of <tt>dfej</tt>, the Daikon Front End
for Java, is available via CVS, and one checked-out version appears in
<tt>~mernst/research/invariants/dfej/src/</tt>.)
<p>

I recommend that you use the latest possible version of the JDK (Java
Development Kit).  A link to this  can always be found at
<tt>/g2/jdk</tt>; you probably want to put the
<tt>bin</tt> subdirectory in your path and to add 
<tt>jre/lib/rt.jar</tt> and <tt>lib/tools.jar</tt> to the end of your
CLASSPATH:
<pre>
  set path = ( /g2/jdk/bin $path )
  setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:/g2/jdk/jre/lib/rt.jar:/g2/jdk/lib/tools.jar
</pre>
<p>

-->



<!-- <h4><a name="classpath"></a>Classpath</h4>

(by Jeremy Nimmer)
<p>

In case anyone is curious, this is how I set my CLASSPATH.  If you use this,
you should change $INV to where your CVS checkout of <tt>invariants</tt> is.
<p>

<pre>
setenv INV ${HOME}/research/invariants
setenv JAVA_HOME /g2/jdk
setenv RTJAR ${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/rt.jar
setenv DAIKON_LIBS `/usr/bin/perl -e 'print join(":", @ARGV);' ${INV}/java/lib/*.jar`
setenv CLASSPATH .:${INV}/java:${DAIKON_LIBS}:${RTJAR}
</pre>

This includes on your path:
<pre>
  .            - the cwd
  $INV/java    - your current checkout of daikon engine
  $DAIKON_LIBS - all of the .jar files in $INV/java/lib
  $RTJAR       - the JDK runtime (for jikes)
</pre>

-->

<h3><a name="getting-daikon"></a>Getting your copy of Daikon</h3>

For work on the PAG machines, you should check out a copy of the system
from the CVS repository.  (This only needs to be done once, though you must
periodically update your copy via <tt>cvs update</tt>.)
Alternately, you can always download and install
Daikon from its .tar.gz distribution.
<!--  (A third option is to add <tt>~mernst/java</tt> or some other
installation to your Java classpath.  This is easy, but is deprecated,
because it does not permit you to modify the system and it does not
insulate you from incompatible changes or partial work of others.)
-->
<p>

Checking out Daikon from the CVS repository has several advantages:
<ul>
  <li>You will have access to a number of files intended for developer use
      which are not present in the distribution.
  <li>It is very easy to update to the latest version of the software,
      retaining any personal customizations you have made.
  <li>You can make changes and incorporate them in the master version of
      Daikon. 
</ul><p>

There are two modules (directories) available via anonymous CVS from
pag.lcs.mit.edu:  <tt>invariants</tt> (the bulk of the Daikon invariant
detection system, which is written in Java) and <tt>dfej</tt> (the Daikon
front end for Java, which is written in C++).
<p>

You can learn how to use CVS from
<a href="http://www.cvshome.org/new_users.html">CVS for new
users</a>, or the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/cvs-1.9/cvs.html">CVS
manual</a> (<a
href="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/index.html">alternate site</a>).
<p>

<h4><a name="local-cvs"></a>Local CVS</h4>

The following commands create and populate the
<tt>~/research/invariants</tt> directory:
<pre>
    mkdir ~/research
    cd ~/research
    chmod +rx ~ ~/research
    cvs -d /g4/projects/invariants/.CVS co invariants
    cd invariants
    cp -p doc/www/mit/Makefile.user java/
    chgrp -R invariants .
    chmod -R g+r .
    chmod g+x `find . -type d -print`
    cd ~/research/invariants
    make setup-v2-and-v3
    make use-ver3
    make compile
</pre>
(The <tt>make use-ver2</tt> line ensures that you use Daikon version
2, rather than the experimental version 3.)
<p>

Before trying to compile (via <tt>make</tt> in any directory under
<tt>$inv/java</tt>, log out and log back in, to set up your environment.
<p>

Optionally, you may check out a copy of the <tt>dfej</tt> directory.
You should not need to do this, however; just use the executable in
<tt>/home/httpd/html/pag/daikon/download/binaries/mit</tt>, which should
already be on your path.  If you do check out the <tt>dfej</tt> directory,
use this command:
<pre>
    cd ~/research/invariants
    cvs -d /g4/projects/invariants/.CVS co dfej
</pre>
<p>

You may also want the <tt>papers</tt> directory
<pre>
    cd ~/research/invariants
    cvs -d /g4/projects/invariants/.CVS co papers
</pre>


<h4><a name="remote-cvs"></a>Remote CVS</h4>

You can also create your copy of the repository on a remote machine (that
is, not a PAG/taproot machine).  You can do so using anonymous CVS or
regular CVS.
<ul>
  <li><a href="../anoncvs.html">Anonymous CVS instructions</a>
  <li><a href="../remote-cvs.html">Regular remote CVS instructions</a>.
      Also, see a description of <a
      href="http://www.cag.lcs.mit.edu/~rugina/ssh-procedures/">using ssh
      without password queries</a>.
</ul>
<p>

If you use remote CVS, you will need to set up your environment properly.
(This was done for you when your PAG account was <a
href="pag-account.html">created</a>, so you don't have
to worry about it when using a local CVS checkout.)
For example, you will want to copy over your dotfiles or at least copy the
contents of the dotfiles in <tt>$inv/doc/www/mit/</tt> (at a minimum,
<tt>.bashrc</tt> or <tt>.cshrc</tt>) to your remote machine, and you may
need to adjust some of their settings (such as the ones that refer to the
PAG filesystem).
<p>

You will also need to install various extra packages, such as Simplify.
See the manual for details.
<p>


<h4><a name="using-cvs"></a>Using CVS</h4>

CVS permits multiple people to simultaneously edit (their own copy of) a
set of files, then merge the changes.  See the CVS manual to learn more.
The key commands are:
<dl>
  <dt><tt>cvs update -d</tt>
  <dd>update your version of the files from the repository
  <dt><tt>cvs diff</tt>
  <dd>show difference between your version and the repository (at the time
      you last updated)
  <dt><tt>cvs add <i>FILENAME ...</i></tt>
  <dd>add a file to the repository (you must also commit it)
  <dt><tt>cvs commit <i>[FILENAME ...]</i></tt>
  <dd>put your version of the file in the repository; don't forget to
      include a descriptive message regarding what changed
</dl>
I find it much easier to perform CVS manipulations in Emacs.  First, put
<tt>(autoload 'cvs-update "pcl-cvs" nil t)</tt> in your <tt>.emacs</tt> file.
Then, you can do <tt>M-x cvs-update</tt> to get a Dired-like listing of
(changed) files in the directory.  As with any Emacs mode, do
<tt>C-h m</tt> (help on mode) for details about how to use CVS mode in
Emacs.<p>

You should do <tt>cvs update</tt> frequently, in order to avoid conflicts
(where someone else has changed something that you have also changed).
Please commit your changes fairly regularly, too, so that others can take
advantage of your changes.  But never commit changes without having tested
them first, and use a descriptive CVS comment when you commit.
<p>


<h3><a name="environment-2"></a>Notes on your environment</h3>

By default, your account uses bash as its shell.  To use another shell, run
the <tt>chsh</tt> command (for instance, <tt>chsh -s /bin/tcsh</tt>), then log
out and log back in.
<p>

For compiling Java programs, you may wish to use <tt>jikes</tt> instead of
<tt>javac</tt>.  Jikes tends to be faster than javac.  If you have any
problems with it, you can always fall back to using javac.  To use jikes,
add the line
<pre>
    JAVAC ?= jikes -g +E +F
</pre>
to your <tt>$inv/java/Makefile.user</tt> file.
<p>

In order to permit other members of the Daikon project to read your files,
you should either make them world-readable, or place them in the
<tt>invariants</tt> group and make them group-readable.  You may or may not
need to re-run the following commands periodically to ensure that new files
are readable, depending on how your environment and editor are set up.
<blockquote>
<pre>
## <em>Do one of the following for each directory the group should be able to read</em>
# <em>To make a directory world-readable:</em>
chmod -R +rx <em>DIR</em>
# <em>To make a directory group-readable, run two commands:</em>
chmod -R g+rx <em>DIR</em>
chgrp -R invariants <em>DIR</em>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>

A few other environment details:
<ul>
  <li>Make sure that all the files in <tt>invariants/scripts</tt> are
      executable:
<pre>
	chmod a+x invariants/scripts/*
</pre>
      (They should be executable already when you check them out from the
      CVS repository, so this step shouldn't be necessary.)
  <li>You can receive an email notification whenever files (in particular
      directories of your choosing) are checked in.  To receive such
      notifications, edit
      <tt>/g4/projects/invariants/.CVS/CVSROOT/loginfo</tt>.  This file is
      under RCS control; in Emacs, do <tt>C-x C-q</tt> before editing it
      and again after editing it.  Note that some of the lists of email
      addresses are space-separated and others are comma-separated.
  <li>Do <b>not</b> run a compute-intensive screen-saver, which can use up
      to 99% of machine time, preventing others from effectively using the
      CPU when you are absent.  (For shared machines, you should log out at
      night, and certainly over the weekend.)  If you use Gnome, set your
      preferences to "no screensaver":
      <ol>
        <li>Click on the little foot in the lower left
	<li>Open the following menus: Programs->Settings->Desktop->Screensaver
	<li>Select "No Screensaver" in the list in the upper left
	<li>Click 'OK'
      </ol>
  <li>To print at LCS, set your PRINTER environment variable in either
      <tt>.cshrc</tt> or </tt>.bashrc</tt>.  (The printers on the various
      floors are labeled with their names.)
</ul>
<p>

Michael Ernst's work related to invariant inference is in
<tt>~mernst/research/invariants/</tt>.  Many, but not all, of the files
under that directory are under CVS version control.  Feel free to look
around, and also see my dotfiles, such as <tt>~mernst/.cshrc</tt>, for
potential customizations (but don't go overboard by copying everything
there).<p>

<h3><a name="Emacs-commands">Emacs commands</a></h3>

The command <tt>M-x daikon-tags-table</tt> sets up Emacs to use the Daikon
TAGS table, which lets you easily find definitions and search through the
entire codebase in Emacs.  (You need to run this command once per instance
of Emacs.)
<p>

The command <tt>M-x daikon-info</tt> views the Daikon manual using the Info
viewer within Emacs.  You may also choose to use the stand-alone viewer, to
use a Web browser to read the manual in HTML form, or to read the
PostScript or PDF version either electronically or on paper.
<p>


<h3><a name="code-conventions">Coding conventions</a></h3>

<h4><a name="comments">Comments</a></h4>

Every code file that you write (Java classes, perl scripts, etc.) needs to
have a comment at the top explaining exactly what is does and (if
applicable) how to run it.  Otherwise it will be a mystery to others -- and
perhaps to you when you return to it.  In some cases one or two sentences
will do; in many other cases, the description needs to be more complete.
Every non-trivial procedure should also contain a brief comment saying what
it does.
<p>

Every class should have a descriptive comment at the top -- perhaps just
one or two sentences, perhaps something more extensive.  This is very
important now that there are many people working on the project, as it will
help those people understand what a class is intended to do.  (It wasn't
always true for code written when there was only one person working on the
project; we will try to correct that code by stages.  If you have problem
with any code, definitely ask for help so the code and/or comments can be
improved.)
<p>

When a comment is a sentence, start it with a capital letter, end it with a
period, and use correct grammar.
Please keep comments to 80 characters and code to 80 characters whenever
possible.  This makes it possible to print the code in a readable fashion
and also to read the code in a standard-sized window.
<p>

Do not comment out large blocks of code with <tt>/*</tt> ... <tt>*/</tt>;
instead, prefix each line by <tt>// </tt>.  Among other things, this does
not lose the indentation of the original code; without that indentation,
the commented-out code is much too hard to read and understand.  It also
makes it clear what is commented out and what is not, even when the code
is printed or is viewed without color highlighting.
<p>

<h4><a name="code-formatting">Code formatting</a></h4>

When code has a consistent style, particularly within a single file but
also over an entire project, the code is much easier to read and
understand.  I don't wish to spend an excessive amount of time or energy
promulgating coding guidelines, but here are a few things to pay
attention to when you contribute to Daikon.
<p>

Use a consistent indentation style.  When editing an existing file, adopt
its indentation style rather than writing your additions in an incompatible
style.  In Emacs, you can use procedure `<tt>c-set-basic-offset</tt>',
defined in <tt>invariants/emacs/c-set-basic-offset.el</tt>, to set the
indentation amount to whatever an existing file already happens to use (for
C and Java code).
<p>

Place whitespace around the outside of grouping punctuation; for instance,
use "<tt>if (foo) bar;</tt>" rather than "<tt>if(foo)bar;</tt>".  (Do not
place whitespace between a procedure name and its arguments.  Together,
these rules ensure that function calls and keyword usage are visually
distinct and easy to differentiate.)  Use "<tt>} else {</tt>" rather than
"<tt>}else{</tt>".  Also place space after <tt>//</tt> that starts a
comment.  Jamming punctuation against other entities in a program makes the
program very hard to read.
<p>

Do not use tabs in code files.  They display differently in different
editors, and they may print differently than they display in an editor.
Always use spaces instead.  (If you are using the group's Emacs
customizations, this should already be set up for you.)
<p>

Do not place files in the CVS repository with DOS-style line separators;
use Unix-style separators (at least when first adding a file).  The CVS
tools don't cope well with DOS line separators; for instance, they may
erroneously indicate that an entire file is modified, making merges and
updates very difficult.  One way to fix a DOS-style file is to do <tt>(setq
buffer-file-coding-system nil)</tt> in Emacs, then save the file.
<p>

Local variables should have the most restrictive scope possible.  For
instance, don't do this:
<pre>
  int x;
  ...
  for () {
    ...
    x = ...;
    ...
  }
</pre>
Instead, do this:
<pre>
  for () {
    ...
    int x = ...;
    ...
  }
</pre>
Loop-carried dependences (the variable is sometimes set on one loop
iteration and used on the next one before being re-set) are the only reason
to declare, external to a loop, a variable that is set in the loop;
reducing scopes makes it clear that there are no loop-carried dependences.
Likewise, if two loops both use a temporary variable, you should declare
two separate variables rather than reusing the same one, to indicate that
there are no inter-loop dependences.
<p>


<h4><a name="perl">Perl</a></h4>

<ol>
  <li>Use <tt>#!/usr/bin/env perl</tt> as the first line, to permit
      independence from the specific location where perl is installed.
  <li>Include the following code, which enables checking for common perl
      errors, near the top of the file (but usually after the brief
      description of the script's purpose and how to use it):
<pre>
  use English;
  use strict;
  $WARNING = 1;
</pre>
  <li>Always check the status for every use of system() or backticks.
      Better yet, use the system_or_die() and backticks_or_die() functions,
      which automatically do the checking.  To use them, put <tt>use
      util_daikon;</tt> near the top of your Perl script (after the <tt>use
      strict;</tt> block).
  <li>Avoid system() and backticks when possible; instead, use Perl
      procedures, which tend to be more portable, more efficient, and
      usually clearer.  For instance, don't do <tt>@files = split('\n', `ls
      *.c`);</tt>; instead, use <tt>@files = glob("*.c");</tt>.
</ol>
<p>


<h3><a name="regression-tests">Testing Daikon</a></h3>

Daikon has two sets of tests:  regression tests and unit tests.
If there are any differences between the expected results and the ones you
get, don't check in your changes until you understand which is the desired
behavior and possibly update the goals.
<p>

The unit tests are found in <tt>invariants/java/daikon/test/</tt>; they use
the JUnit unit testing framework.  They take a few seconds to run.  They
are automatically run each time you compile Daikon (by running
<tt>make</tt> in <tt>$inv/java</tt> or any of its subdirectories).  You can
also run them explicitly via <tt>make unit</tt>.  When you write new code
or modify old code, please try to add unit tests.<p>

The regression tests run Daikon on many different inputs and compare
Daikon's output to expected output.  They take an hour or longer to run.
When you make a change, you should generally run the regression tests
before checking it in.  Always run the regression tests when checking in
any non-trivial change to the code.  If any has a non-zero size, then your
edits have changed Daikon's output and you should not check in without
carefully determining that the changes are intentional and desirable (and
you should update the goal output files, so that the diffs are again zero).
The regression tests appear in the <tt>$inv/tests</tt> directory.  Type
<tt>make</tt> in that directory to see a list of options.  Generally you
will want to run <tt>make diffs</tt> and ensure that the list of diff files
that is created all have zero size.  You do not generally need to do
<tt>make clean</tt>, which forces re-instrumentation (a slow process) the
next time you run the tests.
<p>

You can report bugs, examine reported bugs, and edit or remove existing bug
reports by running the <tt>daikon-bug</tt> program.  Run it without arguments
to see valid arguments.  The typical use is:  a user adds a new bug; the owner
fixes the bug, verifies the fix, and changes the bug status to "fixed"; and
then the original reporter changes the status to "Closed".
(The bugs themselves are stored in directory
<tt>$inv/bugs</tt>, but you shouldn't need to know that.)

<h3><a name="editing-daikon.texinfo"></a>Editing daikon.texinfo</h3>

The Daikon manual appears in <tt>doc/daikon.texinfo</tt>.  The manual is
written using the Texinfo formatting system, which makes it easy to produce
HTML, info, or printed (PostScript and PDF) output.

<p>
You can edit the manual using an ordinary text editor.  You can either
mimic the formatting commands that already appear in the manual or read the
<a href="http://texinfo.org">Texinfo documentation</a>.

<p>
If you wish to create a new section of the manual, insert two lines like
the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
@node    <em>Short title</em>, Foo, Bar, Baz
@<em>chapter</em> <em>Long title</em>
</pre>
</blockquote>
where you should insert "Foo, Bar, Baz" literally (they will be fixed up
for you automatically), you select the short and the long titles (which may
even be the same), and you may replace "@chapter" by "@section",
"@subsection", or "@subsubsection".

<p>
Once you have edited the manual, run <tt>make</tt> twice (yes, you must run
it twice) in order to generate formatted versions of the manual
(<tt>daikon.{html,info,ps,pdf}</tt>).

<h3><a name="distribution">Making a distribution</a></h3>

To publish a Daikon distribution, do the following.  If you only want
to create the <tt>daikon.tar</tt> or <tt>daikon.tar.gz</tt> file, then
simply run <tt>make</tt> with the desired file as the target. <p> <ol>

    <li> It is suggested that you use the daikongroupmember account to
    publish a distribution.  This insures that everything has been committed
    to CVS and that nothing extraneous in your account gets included in the
    distribution.  Ask Michael Ernst for the password.  Note that all of
    the following instructions should work from other accounts as 
    well <p>

    <code> su - daikongroupmember </code> <p>

    <li> Update daikon in daikongroupmember to the most recent version
    of V2. <p>

    <code> 
        cd $inv <br>
        make use-ver2 <br>
        cvs update -d  <br>
    </code> <p>

    <li> Rebuild everything. <p>

    <code>
        cd java <br>
        make <br>
        cd $inv/doc <br>
        make <br>
        cd $inv/dfej <br>
        make
    </code> <p>

    <li> Run the regression tests using the version of dfej that you
    just built. All of the diff files should be of zero size when this
    is complete.<p>

    <code>
        cd $inv/tests <br>
        make clean <br>
        make diffs DFEJ_EXECUTABLE=$inv/dfej/src/dfej<br>
    </code> <p>

    <li> Edit the <tt>doc/CHANGES</tt> file to indicate what has changed
    in this version.  A good way to determine what has changed is to diff 
    the texinfo source files in the doc directory against the previous 
    versions: <p>

    <code>
        cd $inv/doc <br>
        diff -u -s --from-file /home/httpd/html/daikon/dist/doc *.texinfo <br>
    </code> <p>

    <li> Make the distribution and update the website. <p>

    <code>
        cd $inv <br>
        make dist <br>
    </code> <p>

    Note that <code>make dist</code> will automatically update the
    version numbers in the source code and documentation from the file
    <tt>doc/VERSION</tt>.  After doing so, it will correctly update
    the version number in <tt>doc/VERSION</tt>.  This should not
    require any hand intervention unless there is a problem near the
    end of building the distribution and the <code>make dist</code>
    command has to be run again after the version number has been
    incremented.  In this case, simply edit <tt>doc/VERSION</tt> by
    hand back to the correct version number before rebuilding. <p>

    <li> Commit any changes back to CVS <p>

    <code>
        cd $inv <br>
        cvs commit -m "Change version to &lt;X.Y.Z>" <br>
    </code>

    <li> Send mail to the daikon-announce mailing list.  There are sample
    messages in ~mernst/research/invariants/mail/daikon-lists.mail.

</ol> <p>



<h2><a name="reporting">Reporting on your research</a></h2>

The outcome of research -- whether at the UROP, M.Eng., or Ph.D. level --
should be a paper describing what was learned and disseminating that
knowledge for the benefit of other researchers and practitioners.  For
instance, a summer's work might result in a conference or workshop paper.
Please keep in mind where your results might be published and whether what
you are doing contributes to the state of knowledge (either directly or
indirectly).
<p>

Each week, each group member prepares a written progress report as a short
email message.  It only needs to be a couple paragraphs or a page long and
will probably only take 15-30 minutes to compose, but it should explain
what you have accomplished, what you have learned, and what you plan to do
next.  This is very helpful both in permitting others to understand what
you have done, and also in focusing your attention on whether you have been
productive and keeping you on top of your progress.
<!-- <br>
As of summer 2001, the reports are written on Thursdays, and individual
meetings with Michael Ernst are on Fridays.
-->
<p>

Each week, the Daikon group meets to hear a more in-depth report on the
current state of one group member.  Each member presents during group
meeting every 2-3 months.  These presentations may be informal, but they
should be organized in a way that permits others to both understand and
critique the work.  The presentation may use handouts, overhead
transparencies, and/or a whiteboard.  Plan the presentation for 20-30
minutes; questions are likely to draw out the meeting to one hour, but we
will try to avoid meetings longer than that.
