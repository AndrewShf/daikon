<h1>Daikon-related invariant detection publications</h1>

<p>
This page lists publications related to the technique of invariant
detection and to the <a href="../">Daikon invariant
detector</a> tool that implements it.  The page is separated into four
parts:

<dl>
<dt>
<a href="#invariant-detection">Invariant detection technique</a>
<dd>
This section describes the technique of invariant detection and the
implementation of the Daikon invariant detector.

<dt>
<a href="#daikon-methodology">Methodology using invariant detection</a>
<dd>
This section lists publications whose research methodology depends on
running the Daikon tool.  The research uses Daikon's invariant detection as
one step of its technique.  (Research that uses <a href="#other-tools">other
invariant detection tools</a> is not listed here.)

<dt>
<a href="#daikon-testsubject">Daikon as test subject</a>
<dd>
This section lists
publications that use the Daikon invariant detector as a test subject.  For
instance, Daikon has been used as a subject when evaluating regression
testing tools, since it has both a version control repository and a test
suite.

<dt>
<a href="#other-tools">Other invariant detection tools</a>
<dd>
This section briefly lists some other invariant detection tools (besides
Daikon).

The lists of papers and tools are undoubtedly incomplete.  If you know of
other work that should be listed here, or discover an error, please send
mail to <a href="mailto:mernst@csail.mit.edu">mernst@csail.mit.edu</a>.
Thanks.

<p>
Other researchers and commercializers have adopted the idea of invariant
detection, extending the technique and building new tools.  This section
is a selected list of some of those
<a href="#other-tools-industrial">industrial</a> and <a href="#other-tools-academic">academic</a>
efforts.  This is a partial list; please let me know of any others that are
not industrial or academic secrets.

Sun Microsystems

Sudheendra Hangal (who is also responsible for the DIDUCE invariant
detector) and colleagues have built an invariant detector named IODINE for
hardware
designs.  The goal is to execute test vectors or real loads on a simulator
in order to learn emergent properties of the design.  See the paper
"IODINE: A tool to automatically infer dynamic invariants for hardware
designs" in the Design Automation Conference, DAC 2005.

<dt>
Microsoft
<dd>
Trishul Chilimbi is building a high-performance dynamic invariant detector
that operates at garbage collection (GC) time.  Since all of memory must be
scanned then anyway, the invariant detector imposes relatively little
additional cost for its memory accesses.  The invariant detector's grammar
includes run-time types (for checking what types a collection contains),
immutability, and cycles in the object reference graph (the heap).

<dt>
Agitar
<dd>
<a href="http://www.agitar.com/">Agitar</a>'s product, Agitator, performs
dynamic invariant detection in order to inform users about tests, and to
improve those tests.  The results are called "observations", they include
equality:  (x = y), range:  (-10 <= x <= 10), non-null (x != null),
equality (.equals), and properties gleaned from the user's source code.

<h2><a name="other-tools-academic">Academic invariant detection implementations</a></h2>

Stanford
<dd>
The <a href="http://diduce.sourceforge.net/">DIDUCE</a> tool (DIDUCE stands
for "Dynamic Invariant Detection Union Checking Engine")
checks one invariant:  the bitwise or of the values of a variable.  DIDUCE
performs dynamic invariant detection online -- at run time, rather than
after-the-fact.  DIDUCE is described in the paper "Tracking down software
bugs using automatic anomaly detection", by Sudheendra Hangal and Monica
S. Lam (appears in ICSE 2002).

<dt>
Wisconsin and Microsoft
<dd>
The paper "Mining specifications" by Glenn Ammons, Rastislav Bod&iacute;k,
and James R. Larus (appears in POPL 2002) describes a system for inferring
temporal specifications, such as "method <tt>open</tt> must be called
before method <tt>close</tt>.  The sequence of observed method calls is fed
to a machine learner in order to obtain a grammar of permitted call
sequences.

<dt>
Stanford
<dd>
The paper "Automatic extraction of object-oriented component interfaces" by
John Whaley, Michael Martin, and Monica Lam (appears in ISSTA 2002) has the
same goal as that of the "Mining specifications" paper:  determining the
legal sequences of procedure calls (in the paper, called "interfaces").
The paper proposes a combination of static and dynamic methods.

<dt>
Berkeley
<dd>
Ben Liblit's statistical debugging project, described in a variety of <a
href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~liblit/">publications</a>, aims to
permit collecting a small amount of information from a large number of
executions in the field (some faulty, some not) in order to determine which
properties of an execution are most relevant to errors.  Its mechanism for
collecting the information is a type of invariant detection.

<dt>
Brown
<dd>
The Carrot dynamic invariant detection system is described in the paper
"Automated fault localization using potential invariants", by Brock Pytlik,
Manos Renieris, Shriram Krishnamurthi, and Steven P. Reiss.  It is built
partly upon the Daikon infrastructure, but investigates other
implementation strategies.

<dt>
Colorado
<dd>
Two papers by Johannes Henkel and Amer Diwan -- "Discovering algebraic
specifications from Java classes" (appears in ECOOP 2003) and "A tool for
writing and debugging algebraic specifications" (appears in ICSE 2004) --
describe an application of dynamic invariant detection to algebraic
specifications.  Algebraic specifications are equations between terms, such
as "pop(push(s,i).state).retval = i" and "pop(push(s,i).state).state = s".

<dt>
Virginia
<dd>
David Evans and Jinlin Yang are building 
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/terracotta/">Terracotta</a>,
a dynamic analysis tool for automatically inferring temporal properties.
It takes the program's execution traces as input and outputs a set of
likely temporal properties.
