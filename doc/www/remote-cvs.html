<h1>Remote CVS for the Daikon Project</h1>

By Michael Harder

<p>

These instructions show you how to use remote CVS over SSH, without
entering your password every time.  It is assumed you already have CVS
and SSH installed on your machine.

<ol>

<li>Test the SSH installation.  Run:

<pre>ssh -l username sdg.lcs.mit.edu</pre>

You should be prompted for your password, and then logged in.  If not,
your SSH is setup incorrectly.

<p><br>

<li>Setup SSH for passwordless usage.  Make a directory called .ssh in
your home directory.  Then run the following command:

<pre>ssh-keygen -C comment -f ~/.ssh/identity</pre>

comment is an identifier placed in the public key (use your email
address).  Just press enter when it asks you for a passphrase.  You
don't want a passphrase.

<p>

Now you need to set up the server to accept your keys.  Run the secure
copy command to send the identity.pub key to the server:

<pre>scp ~/.ssh/identity.pub username@sdg.lcs.mit.edu:identity.pub</pre>

Then login to the server using the ssh command:

<pre>ssh -l username sdg.lcs.mit.edu</pre>

Now type the following commands into the SSH session (it's OK if the
first command complains that .ssh exists):

<pre>
mkdir ~/.ssh
cat identity.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod -R go-rwx ~/.ssh
rm identity.pub
logout
</pre>

Go back and try logging in with ssh again; now it should log you in
with no password. If it asks for a password, try adding '-v' before
the '-l' and read the logs it prints.

<p><br>

<li>Tell CVS to use SSH.  Set the environment variable CVS_RSH (tcsh syntax):

<pre>setenv CVS_RSH ssh</pre>

You should add this to one of your dotfiles (like .cshrc) so it gets
set every time you log in.

<p><br>

<li>To obtain the invariants module, use:

<pre>
cvs -d :ext:username@sdg.lcs.mit.edu:/g4/projects/invariants/.CVS co invariants
</pre>

To obtain the dfej module, use:

<pre>
cvs -d :ext:username@sdg.lcs.mit.edu:/g4/projects/invariants/.CVS co dfej
</pre>

After executing these commands, you should be able to issue CVS
commands such as

<pre>cvs update</pre>

to have your copy of the repository updated from the master version.

</ol>
