This directory started out as a copy of
~mistere/research/packages/dsaa-to-present/ but has grown into a
central store for all daikon-to-esc auto-translation experiments.

Collections of source for experiements:

  DataStructures/
    Original dsaa code, un-annotated with ESC statments (except for a
    few "by-hand" examples done for reference).  The ESC-annotated
    code goes in separate subdirectories, such as StackAr/

  PolyCalc/
    Original PolyCalc staff solution from 6.170 ST01 ps1

  MapQuick/
    Original MapQuick staff solution from 6.170 ST01 ps2-4

Specific experiments:

  StackAr/
    Trials on StackAr from dsaa

  StreetNumberSet/

  RatPolyStack/

  ... more to come

===========================================================================
** DEPRECATED BELOW **

  daikon-java/
    Instrumented versions of the code; probably un-interesting.

  daikon-output/
    decls and dtrace; probably uninteresting

  dsaa.inv.gz
    Invariants over StackAr when StackArTester is run

  dsaa.txt
    Invariants over StackAr when StackArTester is run

  dsaa-filtered.txt
    Jeremy's by-hand filtering applied to dsaa.txt.
    Jeremy removed implied and obvious invariantes which we hope will
      eventually not be producted by daikon.
    This was the source of the ESC annotations in the
      DataStructures/StackAr.java file.
