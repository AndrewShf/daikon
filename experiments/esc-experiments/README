Manifest:

  DataStructures/
    Original dsaa code, someimtes annotated with ESC statments as
    translated from daikon output

    StackAr.java is intended to be a symbolic link either to
    StackAr.java-escannotated (when running ESC) or to
    StackAr.java-unannotated (when running dfej)

  daikon-java/
    Instrumented versions of the code; probably un-interesting.

  daikon-output/
    decls and dtrace; probably uninteresting

  dsaa.inv.gz
    Invariants over StackAr when StackArTester is run

  dsaa.txt
    Invariants over StackAr when StackArTester is run

  dsaa-filtered.txt
    Jeremy's by-hand filtering applied to dsaa.txt.
    Jeremy removed implied and obvious invariantes which we hope will
      eventually not be producted by daikon.
    This was the source of the ESC annotations in the
      DataStructures/StackAr.java file.
