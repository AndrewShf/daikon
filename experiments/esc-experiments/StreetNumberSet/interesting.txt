=====================================================================

We fail many places because this isn't written into JML:

format_esc class daikon.inv.binary.twoSequence.PairwiseIntComparison
  needs to be changed: this.begins[] <= this.ends[] (elementwise)

Also, test suite still has spurious constants.
