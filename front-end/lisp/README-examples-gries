This directory contains declaration and trace files generated from runs of
some programs from chapters 14 and 15 of David Gries's book _The Science of
Programming_.  You can run the Daikon invariant detector on these files
without having to instrument and run the programs to create the files
yourself.  Briefly, you should be able to do

  java daikon.Daikon gries-instrumented.decls p180-15.1.1.dtrace

See the daikon.html file at the top level of the Daikon distribution for
details on running the system.
