Todo list sorted in approximate order of importance.

  - Fix --ppt-omit-pattern and --ppt-select-pattern to work on each
    ppt point name rather than only on class names.  I think this means
    we should consider a class instrumented if any of its methods
    match.  I think this change should be largely back compatible with 
    their current usage.

  - Support DDTRACELIMIT and DDTRACELIMITTERMINATE environment variables
    just as dfej does.  This is partially in Runtime right now, but
    we need to call the proper methods when writing so it fully
    works.

  - Add a Java 5.0 test to the test suite.   This will checkout not
    only Chicory, but annotate as well.  Carlos suggested the files
    in ~jhp/tmp/bst.tar

  - Add a simple test of chicory to the tests that are performed on
    the build itself (before it is copied to the website).

  - Switch over the regression tests to chicory, leaving dfej as a
    user option.  Checkin the changed goal files.

  - Fix the output/err stream redirection to flush on each line feed
    so we see results in real time.

  - Add dtrace goal files (perhaps limited to some reasonable number
    of lines) to the regression tests.  This will allow us to see
    more quickly when a Chicory change causes dtrace diffs.

  - Write a new dtrace-diff program in Jana.  There is probably already
    Jana code that can read a dtrace file.  The diff should be very
    simple at that point.

  - Implement online mode 

  - Restructure code so we don't calculate the same thing on each
    method entry/exit, but just once when processing the class.  This
    is not so much an optimization as a code cleanup so if we change,
    for instance, what variables are instrumented or their order we
    only have to change it in one place.

  - Produce output not merely about the concrete representation of a data
    structure, but also about its abstract state, by creating new synthetic
    variables whose values come from the results of calling pure
    (non-side-effecting) methods.  For example, if we have
      class Point {
        double x;
        double y;
        double rho() { return Math.sqrt(x*x+y*y); }
        double theta() { return Math.atan2(x, y); }
      }
    then we could imagine reporting properties such as 
    "myPoint.theta() < 6.28".  There are existing purity analyses that we
    could use to determine which methods are safe to call; reusing such an
    analysis could make this extension pretty easy.

  - Implement --linked-lists option.


Completed Tasks

  - Cleanup directory structure in $inv/chicory,  remove JDI based files
  
    Feb 07 2005 jhp - Moved everything actually used to the single
    directory $inv/daikon/chicory.  Chicory.java itself was placed in
    the directly in $inv/daikon.
