This file describes how to merge the changes on the ENGINE_V2_PATCHES
branch of the $inv/java/daikon part of the repository into the trunk
(which is version 3 of Daikon).

(1) Ensure that your V3 checkout is up to date, and builds:

  cd $inv/java
  make use-redesign
  cvs up
  make
  
(2) Make a backup of your current version of the trunk

  cd $inv
  tar cvfz daikon.redesign.tar.gz daikon.redesign/

(3) Update V3 using cvs.  Construct the date token for the first -j
    switch using the topmost (most recent) entry from the merge
    history at the end of this document.

  cd $inv/daikon.redesign
  cvs up -j "ENGINE_V2_PATCHES:10-Mar-2002 16:33" -j ENGINE_V2_PATCHES

(4) Add a line to the top of the merge history (at the bottom of this
    file) noting the precise time you ran the cvs command in step 3.

(5) Use PCL-CVS (or some other, less-capable tool) to fix all
    conflicts created during the merge, so that the project compiles.

(6) Edit the code and unit tests until all unit tests pass (regression
    tests need not pass).

(7) Examine any modified files you think are deserving before you commit.

(8) Commit the files under $inv/daikon.redesign to CVS, using a log
    message that communicates the time you ran step 3 (which is the
    same as the time at the top of the merge history).  Be sure to
    commit your changes to this file, as well.
