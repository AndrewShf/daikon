This file describes how to merge the changes on the ENGINE_V2_PATCHES
branch of the $inv/java/daikon part of the repository into the trunk
(which is version 3 of Daikon).

(1) Ensure that your V2 checkout is up to date, and builds:
    Commit if the last command shows any diffs.

  cd $inv/java
  make use-ver2
  cvs -q update
  make
  cvs -q diff --brief

(2) Ensure that your V3 checkout is up to date, and builds.
    Commit if the last command shows any diffs.

  cd $inv/java
  make use-ver3
  cvs -q update
  make
  cvs -q diff --brief

(3) Make a backup of your current version of the trunk

  cd $inv
  tar cfz daikon.ver3.tar.gz daikon.ver3/

(4) Update V3 using cvs.  Construct the date token for the first -j
    switch using the topmost (most recent) entry from the merge
    history at the end of this document.

  cd $inv/daikon.ver3
  cvs up -j "ENGINE_V2_PATCHES:10-Mar-2002 16:33" -j ENGINE_V2_PATCHES
  make tags
  date

(5) Add a line to the top of the merge history (at the bottom of this
    file) noting the precise time you ran the cvs command in step 3.

(6) Use PCL-CVS (or some other, less-capable tool) to fix all
    conflicts created during the merge, so that the project compiles.
    Use "d E" or "d e" on each file with a conflict.  It skips
    over hunks that differ only in whitespace.

(7) Edit the code and unit tests until all unit tests pass.
    Regression tests should pass at least to the extent that they
    did before the merge.

(8) Examine any modified files you think are deserving before you commit.

(9) Commit the files under $inv/daikon.ver3 to CVS, using a log
    message that communicates the time you ran step 3 (which is the
    same as the time at the top of the merge history).  Be sure to
    commit your changes to this file (merging.txt), as well.
