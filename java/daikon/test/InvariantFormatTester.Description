Files should be formatted in the following manner:

InvariantFormatTester.<format name>:

<fully qualified class name>
<type string>
<sample>* <- 0 or more samples

The file format should be the same regardless of blank or commented lines
except in the samples area. No blank lines or comments should appear after the type
string before the first sample or between parts of samples (these lines are used
currently to determine where samples lists end). This will be remedied in a
future version of the tester.

Type string:
A type string must consist of one or more of the following:
"int","double","string","int_array","double_array","string_array", seperated by
spaces (without the quotes)
This string represents the types that an invariant is supposed to compare
For instance, a binary integer comparison would have type string "int int".
A pairwise sequence comparison would have type string "int_array int_array"

Samples:
Values formatted according to the type string, one value per line
Example: Formatting for samples of a binary integer comparison

int int <- no comment/blank lines after this
1 <- or before this
2
2 <-|__ Pair of values
3 <-|

Please see the included goal files (InvariantFormatTester.<format>.goal) for
further examples and modify them to more fully cover other output formats.

The output of a test run can be converted into a goals files by using the --generate_goals
switch to the tester as follows:

java daikon.test.InvariantFormatTester --generate_goals

Note that this test is included in the set of tests performed by the master tester, and
so it is not necessary to seperately run this test except to generate goal files.

When creating a new invariant to test with this framework, you must create a (public) constructor
for that invariant to be constructed from a PptSlice (restatement: a method "public <invariant name>(PptSlice)"
must exist) or else this framework will not be able to instantiate the invariant.

Furthermore, this framework cannot parse complex types from files unless they contain a
"public (Object) valueOf(String s)" function. Otherwise the program has no was of knowing how
to create such an object from a string. All primitives and the String type are already recognized.
