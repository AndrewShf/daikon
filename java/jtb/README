The files in this directory were generated using JTB 1.3.2 (the Java
Tree Builder; look for "java jtb" in google) and javacc (version 3.2),
as follows:

  cd ${INV}/java/jtb

  java -classpath ~/jtb/jtb132.jar:$CLASSPATH EDU.purdue.jtb.JTB -pp -tk -p jtb -printer Java1.5.jj 

  javacc jtb.out.jj 

  fix package name of files generated by javacc

  cp Token.java.modified Token.java

  cd ${INV}/java

  find ./jtb -name "*.java" | xargs javac

  manually modified some files to suit my needs. All modifications are commented and have the
  name "Carlos Pacheco" in the comments (so you can search for them).

  copied over boilerplate Makefiles from ${INV}/java/daikon into subdirectories.

The file "Token.java.modified" was obtained from the javaCC CVS
repository (under javacc/examples/JavaGrammars/1.5; version 1.1 of the
file). The file Java1.5.jj is from the same above repository (version
1.3 of the file), modified slightly by Jens Palsberg to work with JTB.


java-1.5 com.rc.retroweaver.Weaver -source jtb
for x in `find jtb -name "*.java"` ; do mv $x $x.renamed ; done

===========================================================================

Daikon uses JTB for parsing and unparsing expressions.  
JTB is used by the daikon.runtimechecker and daikon.split packages.

JTB 1.3.2 was released in 2005.  It is the last version of JTB -- JTB is no
longer maintained.  JTB 1.3.2 is rather old and does not support recent
versions of Java, but there would be no benefit to updating JTB because
Java's expression syntax has not changed appreciably since the last release
of JTB.
