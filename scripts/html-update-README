The "html-update" package contains three small scripts that you may find
helpful for automatically updating your webpages.

html-toc automatically creates a table of contents for a webpage.
	Users do not typically call this script directly.
html-update-toc calls html-toc, and, if the generated table of contents
	differs from the webpage's table of contents, updates the webpage.
update-link-dates finds and updates webpage text that refers to the date
	and/or size of a linked-to file.  Requires checkargs.pm.

For an example of use of both html-update-toc and update-link-dates, see

feature of update-link-dates, see http://pag.csail.mit.edu/daikon/download/.
