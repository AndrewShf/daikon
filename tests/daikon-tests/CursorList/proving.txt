Every CursorList created uses a header node, which is not freed when
the list is garbage-collected, so creating many lists uses up lots of
the node space.  I wonder if the book says anything about this?

Certain invariants we find depend not only on that fact that every
element in any list is non-null, but also that everything in the free
list has a null element.

Certain operations require 0..99 bound, or must ensure those those
results.  Since 0 is the free list pointer, and the test suite doesn't
push up to 99, we don't get these bounds.

ESC has lots of cautions about parameters used in \old() notation,
since many of the quantifications simply pull out the int parameter
from within an orig slice.  There's often at least 50+ of these
cautions.
