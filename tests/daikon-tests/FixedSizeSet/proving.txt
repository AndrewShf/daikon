Everything gets proved.

Many cautions about a primitive parameter variable not being modified,
when it is pulled out of an orig array slice as a range bound.

WENT AWAY: Two errors, of what should be to daikon logically redundant
invariants.  I suspect that missing "makes sense" guards would cause
simplify to remove these and/or ESC to accept them.

TODO: OneOf formatting could be updated so Simplify would remove one
invariant.
