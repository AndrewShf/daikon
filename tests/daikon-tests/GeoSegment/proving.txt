Everything proves.

I have not explored how many are redundant.

FIXED: We are missing the this.name != null invariant, since dfej
doesn't instrument String hashCodes.  Mike is going to fix this.

FIXED: Also, the owner stuff makes us die.  We should probably only
say that we are the owner of array, or better yet, only own things
which are created within the constructor (static analysis).
