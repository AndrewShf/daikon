dfej breaks the code, so I have to edit the instrumented source by
hand.  This is minor.

TODO: Contains one test suite artifact -- containsNode never called to
return false.

Only warnings are about Set typing requirements - we never set the
refined types, so ESC goes crazy.  Even saying as much as I can to ESC
(Set[GeoSegment -> Set]), it still needs to know that the type of the
inner Set, which I don't know how to say.  It would be nice if ESC
defaultd to Object for collection types always, and only if you wanted
to enfore a refined type would it beat on you.

DONE: We also need to annotate JUnit assert to say what it does.
