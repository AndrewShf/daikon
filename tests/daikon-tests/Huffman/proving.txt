Semtics of Daikon don't match ESC, casuing great pain, e.g
 in Daikon     this.symbol.symbol != null
 really means  ((this != null) && (this.symbol != null)) ==> (this.symbol.symbol != null)

Some non-nullness invariants were missing, which didn't help.

We didn't get anything about the elemnt type of the java.util.Lists -
perhaps dfej doesn't instrument or take the elements of these?  Since
we downcast out of them, this would be important to have.

Daikon is very slow - symbol():::EXIT takes >1000 seconds to run,
mostly in the conditional ppt phase (the initial_processing isn't too
bad).
