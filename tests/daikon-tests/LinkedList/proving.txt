The ListNode invariants did not get merged - perhaps the lack of a
public modifier confused merge-esc.pl.

We get many "pointer != pointer" invariants in the set, I should
really diable that invariant during EXPERIMENTS.

There are two or three null dereference errors noted by ESC.  To
remove these, we have to say that the closure of the list (after the
header) has elements which are all non-null.  I don't know of a
straightforward way to say this in ESC.  In any case, we do get this
in Daikon:

  this.header.~next~[].element elements != null

Perhaps the daikon-depth needs to be hight to find this?  If Daikon
can be made find it, it would be an interesting example for the
problems section of the paper.
