# This directory is for testing IOA output from the RSM automaton for
# Daikon.  The .decls and dtrace files
# are generated by the IOA Simulator.  The source files are from
# Lamport's RSM algorithm, codified in IOA by Bogdanov in his
# M.Eng. thesis.

# Presently, this test is not part of the Daikon test suite, but will
# be incorporated once its errors go away.  The main error is:
# repeated reporting of the same invariant.  Look at line 1000 in the
# output file.

# Read Makefile.common for what all of this means
