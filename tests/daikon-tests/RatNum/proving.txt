We will never be able to prove the gcd invariant.

All but one of the verified but redundant invariants are that T's rep
invariant holds on arguments of type T, and on objects returned of
type T.  In the future, it would be reasonable to say this.

FIXED: This example looks promising, but has a really bad test suite.
Also, we might consider fixing up the Bound.jpp invariants to use a
different statistical test, if test suite additions don't fix things.

FIXED: Parse needs a non-null argument (string pointer dfej fixed).
