This example will never work.  Daikon instruments the Vector contents
and find cool invariants there, but ESC doesn't talk about the vector
in the same say that Daikon does, so also all of the merged
invariants don't parse for ESC.

Even if I pare the output down to the five or so invariants which are
easily expressible, missing annotations having to do with the ghost
fields of Vector do me in.
