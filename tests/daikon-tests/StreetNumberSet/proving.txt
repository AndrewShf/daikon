JUnit assert statement needs to get annotated.

Test suite yields strange upper bound errors, and needs to create a
street with number zero.

Constructor isn't getting a non-null argument invariant?

Owner annotations should be set immediately after the object is
assigned, or after the field initializer.

Had to add this axiom:
  /*@ axiom (\forall int i; ((i & 1) == 0) || ((i & 1) == 1)) */

Contains has some weird RHSs of implications, since we don't have the
entry ppt as a controlling thing for simplify.

orderStatistic and size are too complicated for simplify to prove a
positive result (given current annotations).  Perhaps adding the
begins <= ends elementwise would be enough?

isEmpty has some weird artifacs, like begins[*] > begins.length
isEmpty is never called to return true

min and max never got result >= 0

min and max had \exists which didn't work out, perhaps because we need
to require than !isEmpty?

intersects never had argument != null, perhaps we're not calling it

in equals(Object), ESC doesn't seem to know about instanceof

equals and had some weird artifacs, like begins[*] > begins.length; in
general too may artifacts
