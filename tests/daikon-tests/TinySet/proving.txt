Invariants are good, but can't be proved by ESC because it doesn't know
about the semantics of bitwise operations.  One consideration would be
to write up some axioms about bitwise logic, and say how it affects
integers, but this may require some bitwise semantics to say anything
at all (or perhaps we can get around that by saying everything is very
labored, specific statements, like these integer ranges imply this bit
is set, etc.).
