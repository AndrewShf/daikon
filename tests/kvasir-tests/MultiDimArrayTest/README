MultiDimArrayTest.comp and MultiDimArrayTest.invs fail (64 bits only)
due to the 'multiple struct members in a single register' problem.
This will require a significant amount of work in Kvasir to repair.

The fault is that globalBoo.a and globalBoo.b are incorrectly placed
in the same invariant set.

-::globalBoo ::globalBoo.a
-::globalBoo.b
+::globalBoo ::globalBoo.a ::globalBoo.b
