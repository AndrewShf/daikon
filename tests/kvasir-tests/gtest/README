This test case comes from the Google C++ Testing Framework.
It is a sample program provided with the release.
The version used was gtest-1.6.0.

It will always fail the dtrace compare due to program variables
containing elapsed time. So we just ignore the dtrace file.

Also, the results of running the test depend upon the path name of
the directory the test is run in.  The goal files were run on:
/homes/gws/markro/invariants/daikon/tests/kvasir-tests/gtest.

If you run the test elsewhere you may get a single line diff
in gtest.counts of the form:
-../src/gtest_all.cc.testing::internal::IsPathSeparator(char) ENTER/348: 76 EXIT0/351: 76
+../src/gtest_all.cc.testing::internal::IsPathSeparator(char) ENTER/348: 81 EXIT0/351: 81
The different numbers are a reflection of the difference in
the length of the path names.

You might also see two diffs of about 210 lines in gtest.comp.diff.
This one is harder to characterize.
