This test may get a failure in the tot_info.out file due to the fact
that Kvasir does tag garbage collection during runtime. 
You may consider the test successful if the only diff is of the form:

-   Done garbage collecting (next tag = 9934688, total assigned = 10000000)
+   Done garbage collecting (next tag = 9935542, total assigned = 10000000)
