Utilities for performing clustering on vector data or difference
data, creating dendrograms. 
http://odur.let.rug.nl/~kleiweg/clustering/clustering.html

This software package offers several utilities for performing clustering on data
sets. Input can be either a set of vectors or a table with difference
values. Several programs piped together finally result in a PostScript image of
a dendrogram, or an on-screen image (Unix/X11 or MS-DOS).

Files:

* Makefile -- Unix Makefile for all programs.

* difftbl.c -- For conversion of vector data into a difference table, using one
of several difference measures. Updated 2001/12/06 

* cluster.c -- Data clustering on a difference table, using one of several
algorithms. Updated 2001/12/06

* den.c -- Program for transforming clustering data into a PostScript image of a
dendrogram. Updated 2001/12/06

on-screen image of a dendrogram. Updated 2000/08/14

Usage
=====

All programs read input either from stdin or from a file, and write to stdout,
except for denxview and denview. You can examine the data files used in the
examples below to learn about their syntax.

A typical usage is:

difftbl vector-file | cluster -w | den PostScript-file

But you can substitute your own program in any part of this pipe.

==========
1) difftbl
==========
Updated 2001/12/06, Version 1.02: New option -o

This program reads a file with data vectors, and produces a difference
table. The program has the following options:

-c 
  Use city block distance.
-e 
  Use Euclidean difference (default).
-p
  Use 1 - Pearson correlation coefficient.
-s
  Use square difference.
-o filename
  Output file
-P
  Generate pair listing

Example: 
    difftbl  NLchars.vec > NLchars.dif

==========
2) cluster
==========
Updated 2001/12/06, Version 1.02: New option -o

Updated 2001/11/15, Version 1.00: small code changes, recompiled with
GCC for Windows (previous version had no version number)

This program is an implementation of seven different clustering
algorithms, which are described in:

AnilK. Jain and RichardC. Dubes.
Algorithms for Clustering Data; Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1988.

The program reads a difference file, and creates a clustering.
What clustering algorithm to use is defined by the following options:

-sl
  Single Link (Nearest Neighbor)
-cl
  Complete Link
-ga
  Group Average
-wa
  Weighted Average
-uc
  Unweighted Centroid (Centroid)
-wc
  Weighted Centroid (Median)
-wm
  Ward's Method (Minimum Variance)

Other options:

-o filename
  Output file
-u
  Unsorted


Example:
    cluster -wm  NLchars.dif > NLchars.clu


Please note the order of the data in the input file. Lines starting with
a hash (#) are only comments. They do not define the order of the data.

======
3) den
======

This program transforms a clustering file into a PostScript image of a
dendrogram. Labels in the input data may contain all characters from the ISO
Latin 1 character set. The program has the following options:

-2
  Produce PostScript Level 2, that is, assume the
  ISOLatin1Encoding array has already been defined.
-a
  Curved links (default: rectangular).
-b  float
  Usually, 0 is used as the offset, or the minimum value in the
  clustering data if that value is negative. You can use this option to
  define the offset yourself.
-c
  Color links (with number of groups from 2 through 19). The colors
  corresponds to those used by the program  ../dialects/psarea.
-C
  Color labels (with number of groups from 2 through 19). The colors
  corresponds to those used by the program  ../dialects/psarea.
-e float
  Exponent (default: 1.0). The cluster values are raised to this
  exponent. The values on the ruler are adjusted likewise. For example,
  to get the square root of the values, use: -e.5
-E
  Print an example cluster file.
-f int
  Fontsize (default: 8).
-L
  No labels.
-n int
  Number of groups (default: 1). The dendrogram will be split in a
  number of groups, with extra space between the groups. This
  option is required if you want colors or patterns.
-o filename
  output file
-p
  Placement of labels in two columns,
  making room for twice the number of labels.
-P
  Patterns (implies: -2 -L, with number of groups from 2 through 19). The patterns
  corresponds to those used by the program  ../dialects/psarea.
-r int
  Line skip for ruler (in points, 1 point = 1/72 inch).
-R
  No ruler.
-s int
  Line skip within groups (in points, 1 point = 1/72 inch).
-S int
  Line skip between groups, see option -n (in points, 1 point = 1/72 inch).
-t
  Triangular links (default: rectangular).
-T
  Helvetica usually looks better in diagrams, Times-Roman in running text. 
  The old version of den used Times-Roman.

Example
    den  NLchars.clu >  NLchars.ps

===========
5) denxview
===========

This program (Unix only) reads a clustering file and displays a
dendrogram in a window on the X11 display. To quit the program, type
'q' in the window. Options:

-b  float
  See: den.
-f  fontname
  A valid X11 font name. For really large dendrograms you could use
  a 5x8 font.

==========
6) clgroup
==========
This program prints a cluster grouping from a cluster file. Options:

-n  int
  Number of groups
-i
  Indexed output
-o filename
  Output file

With indexed output, labels are &quot;quoted&quot; if there are spaces or tabs in the
labels, or if the label starts with a quote.

Examples:
    clgroup -n 3  NLchars.clu >  NLchars.txt
    clgroup -n 3 -i NLchars.clu >  NLchars-i.txt

Example clustering file

The next example is used to illustrate the syntax of a clustering
definition. It describes the dendrogram in the figure at the top of this document.


    # Example cluster file

    1 .12
    L Norwegian
    L Swedish

    2 .15
    C 1
    L Danish

    3 .3
    L Dutch
    L German

    4 .35 Nordic group
    L Icelandic
    C 2

    5 .7
    C 4
    C 3

Empty lines are ignored. Anything starting with # is treated as
a comment.

A clustering definition is a set of descriptions of clusters. Each
cluster has an index number, a value, and two links to either other
clusters or to labels. There can also be an optional textual comment.

Each cluster is defined in three lines.

* The first lines contains a number used for identification. Each cluster needs
  an unique integer index number.<br> Following the index is a value that
  defines the difference between the two sub-clusters or labels.<br> Any text
  following the difference value is treated as a description to be added to this
  particular cluster.

* The second lines describes what the first item of this cluster is. It can be
  either a sub-cluster or a label.<br> A sub-cluster is indicated with a letter
  C followed by the index number of that sub-cluster.<br> A label is indicated
  with a letter L followed be the text of the label itself.  The third line
  describes the second item of this cluster. The syntax is identical to the
  second line.


Cluster definitions can be given in any order. Swapping the second and
third line in a definition swaps the two branches of this cluster in the
output figure.

Compare the items in the above example to the figure.<br>
Cluster number 1 has two labels, Norwegian and Swedish.
This cluster is indicated in the figure by the line
connecting Norwegian to Swedish.<br>
Cluster number 4 has one label, Icelandic and a sub-cluster with number
2. It connects the label Icelandic to the cluster containing Norwegian,
Swedish and Danish. The description 'Nordic group' is placed at the
right of the connecting line.<br>
Cluster number 5 has two sub-clusters. It connects the cluster containing
the Nordic group to the cluster containing Dutch and German.
